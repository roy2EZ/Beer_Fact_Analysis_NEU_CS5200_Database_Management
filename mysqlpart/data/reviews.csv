1,271781,bluejacket74,3/17/17," 750 ml bottle, 2016 vintage, bottle #304 of 360. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stuck around a little while. There's also a good amount of lacing. I like the aroma, the brew smells like dark fruit (raisin, plum), chocolate, roasted malt, and a bit of licorice. For the most part I think the taste is just like the aroma, but with some coffee flavor noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with a moderate amount of carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, worth picking up if you want a nice straight forward imperial stout. Here's hoping Four String brings this back in the future! $9.99 a bottle. "

4,125646,GratefulBeerGuy,12/20/17," 0% 16 oz can. Funny story: As I finally walked in the doors after a 45 min wait in line and freezing temps the sweet sound of the Grateful Dead's Sugar Magnolia greeted me from the TreeHouse sound system. The bottom of the can reads: ""Going where the wind goes, bloomin' like a red rose"" A white haze to the yellow and golden liquid. Thick and healthy, totally unfiltered. Brawny white foam cap, thick, all-white clumps. Huge lacing left over. The aroma has a very zesty citrus hop effect, mellon and mango, grainy earthiness, tropical fruit blend with a bitter to sweet effect, then a peppery kick at the end. Very aromatic. The flavor is just bursting with complex hops, zesty earthy tones, sweet orange, peppery malt, clean fresh feel and overall vibe. A crispy bite wakes you up, full and lush mouthfeel follows from a totally unfiltered expereince. The feel and flavor finishes with a fun, earthy, zesty dry bite. Tropical juicy, zesty citrus, zippy golden wheat malt, melons, rustic earthiness sums up the taste pretty well. Levels of complexity are deep. It's an interesting ride for sure. Overall, this one stands somewhere near the top of the New England IPA's. "
5,125646,LukeGude,12/20/17, Classic TH NEIPA. Overflowing head and bouquet. Strong flavor but smoother than 8.2%. Maybe peach nose but overall a general citrus punch.

8,125646,MFMB,12/16/17," Pours a creamy opaque light straw yellow with a whispy frothy white head. Nose is of citrus skin and light pine. Taste is a thing of beauty! A nice citrus punch in the mouth. Both peeland zest as well as juice of oranges, grapefruit and lemon. Nice malt backbone although minimal presence, you know its there because the hoppyness of this beer is perfectly balanced. Meadium creamy body. Smooth to drink. Finishes with with a Nice pungent citrus bitterness that leaves you craving the next sip to start the process over again. By far my favorite Treehouse brew of the 4 or 5 I’ve had. "

Nice juicy taste with a good amount of citrus and some piney resin at the end. Bitterness is spot on. A little on the heavy side, but excellent. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. "

Overall not quite as flavorful as I had hoped and the alcohol comes through which is a surprise. Missing the mark of the typical TH pillowy mouthfeel as well. Consumed at just past 3 weeks, possibly past its prime. "

29,205644,Brutaltruth,3/29/17," From the tall boy can and enjoyed in a snifter via a friend from work---THANKS JUSTIN! This unique brown pours a deep muddy blackish brown with an excellent head of dark tan foam that subsides to a thick ring, modest pool, and features some nice sudsy lacing. Nose of coconut milk, cocoa, and light cola notes. Flavors lightly exceed the nose with deeply roasted coconut with dark cola and cocoa flavors with a touch of chicory note to it on the rear of the taste. Nice mouth feel; coating, medium carbonation, medium body, and a bitter malt finish with just of touch of herbal hops. Overall it is a nice unique little brew. Cheers "

Sweet with plenty of coconut and cocoa, but with something different..a twist. There’s also a spiciness, like chicory in there…like a root beer spice. This one is really packed with deep flavor, rich and unusual. Not your father’s coconut brown ale, yes. Delicious, for sure! "

38,150672,byronic,4/14/16," Poured a bit lively and had to wait for it to settle very nice lacing. Slightly hazy golden straw. Floral notes maybe a hint of citrus. Quite smooth on the palate a touch bitter and definitely a pungent finish as advertised. Somewhat of a dry finish and something about the lingering taste is off. The mouth coating is a touch creamy.

44,150672,wanderingspirit,12/20/15," Quite balanced and distinct IPA of a West Coast style IPA from this small prairie city brewery. Packs a punch at 7abv but the bite is layered by pine and citrus aroma and taste, but a nice malt finish and stands up to many west coast IPAs. Nice start for Black Bridge. "
45,150672,Phyl21ca,11/22/15," Can: Poured a clear amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of citrusy hops notes with some light dry caramel malt notes. Taste is also dominated by citrusy hops notes with medium bitter notes with some dry caramel malt notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Slightly better than your standard IPA. "

51,150672,KingHoppy,8/14/15," Passing through Swift Current SK, I stopped at Original Joe's for a late night meal. Many times previously, they had no IPAs whatsoever so I almost didn't ask but when I did, I was pleasantly surprised they were now carrying the hometown craft beer IPA! by Black Bridge Brewery. Notes of citrus, pine, floral, everything you could want in an IPA and with a respectable 7% alcohol kick as well. Very well balanced with the malt. Immediately it was one of my favorite American style IPAs. The next day I went to the Swift Current liquor store and bought three 4-packs. I haven't seen it outside of Swift Current, SK but since it's a new brewery they will surely expand to other locations. If you're passing through Swift Current, you got to try this beer - otherwise keep your eyes open for it in your local beer store. "

59,150672,Saskadan,2/10/15,
60,150672,biboergosum,12/26/14," 355ml can, the latest from this nascent craft brewery from Swift Current, Saskabush. This beer pours a clear, medium copper amber hue, with four flabby fingers of puffy, rocky, and somewhat bubbly bone-white head, which leaves some exploded bike chain lace around the glass as things quickly subside. It smells of pungent, and sort of dank piney, leafy hops straight off, with a strong pithy orange, white grapefruit, and lemon rind citrus fruit abettor, some chalky flintiness, and a middling grainy caramel malt sweetness. The taste is gritty, grainy pale and semi-sweet caramel malt, a muddled green forest floor detritus bitterness, musty orange, lemon, and pineapple citrus notes, a still persistent earthy flintiness, and the suggestion of a hint of a wisp of metallic warming alcohol. The carbonation is fairly peppy and engaging in its low-key fizzy and outright frothy nature, the body an adequate medium weight, and more or less smooth, the hops displaying some down-home hospitality, they are. It finishes off-dry, the malt not ready to cede the flag just yet, while the hops start a campaign to consider a plan to circle the wagons. A pleasantly rendered, high-octane IPA, the hops more prevalent up top, but that's ok, the beer overall doesn't lag as a result, like some. Anyways, nice to see another well made local-ish IPA, and in cans to boot - hope to see this still around next summer, when I finally try to get back out camping, toddler in tow. "

70,104824,Fcolle2,5/27/14," Batch 209 Pours thick dark viscous black in color with a thin fizzy film of a head that disappears rather quickly. Smell has some decadent rich caramel and toffee aromas along with a bourbon soaked raisin sweet aroma and lightly tart dark red cherry aroma.Tons of vanilla tannins and barrel notes are balanced along side some light roasted marshmellow, and bourbon notes. Taste follows the nose with a big caramel and toffee sweetness hitting the palat first along side some fig and date flavors. Loads of vanilla tannin and toasted marshmellow come out along with some oak barrel and bourbon flavors,roasted malt, a walnut like nutty flavor and moderate amounts alcohol in the finish. Super tastey. Mouthfeel is really rich and creamy, a nice sipping beer. Completely costs the mouth with sticky sweet goodness. "

73,104824,AaronBurr,5/26/14,
74,104824,kevanb,5/24/14," 12oz bottle poured into a Pipeworks snifter. The beer pours a jet black color and has extreme opacity with a very thick texture. A thin but taut khaki head rises that has decent retention and leaves some spotted lace behind. The aroma is wonderful, plenty of vanilla bean, lots of toasted coconut, lots of earthy wood with light bourbon, chocolate is bittersweet and brings out both a light roast quality and some hazelnuts. It's very complex but easily approachable and inviting. The flavors are just as impressive, massive coconut presence with some strong vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, bourbon, charred wood with a bit of chalkiness in small doses. The body is a bit lighter than I expected, very silky and it coats the mouth well while the finish is delicate and smooth. Verdict: An absolute stunner from Pipeworks. A textbook example of improving upon a base beer using barrels, adds not only complexity but depth. The balance of flavors is wonderful, everything in harmony, both sweet and earthy. This is easily my favorite Pipeworks beer to date and a remarkably good stout. "

Flavor is toffee up front, with some roasty chocolate in there as well. Maybe this isn't super unique or standout, but it does go down smoothly, and Backyard Porter is a faithful and flavorful English-style porter. "

108,74580,grogged,5/15/12," On tap at the Red Lion Grog House. Served in 16 oz glass w/ Fountain Square Brewing logo. Pours a deep brown with a creamy tan head that looks delicious. The smell was fragrant, almost earthy, yet slight off. Roasted coffee comes to mind, but there's an industrial whiff to it also. The mouthfeel is different. The carbonation stands out noticeably and not for the better. Full, yet fizzy and inconsistent. The coffee taste comes to the fore and so does the bitterness. The problem I had with this beer is that the bad carbonation notes and the bitterness linger too long in the brut(al) finish. I can love a beer that's slightly off, but this one was too far off for me. A drain pour. "
109,74580,aasher,2/8/12," On draft at McKenzie River off of 82nd St. This arrived a medium bodied coca brown in color on the verge of black with a one finger cream colored head. The nose features slight coffee, slight dark chocolate, and bitter roast. It solid, more bitterness than most. The flavors feature coffee and cream first and foremost. The chocolate is light subtly sweet. It finishes off dry and bitter. It drinks smoothly and between light and medium in body. Overall this is a solid beer and a nice first experience from this brewer. I'll try more of their beers in the future. "
110,58482,Imstillthegman,8/17/09," This one pours a cloudy rusty orange with about a fingers worth of off-white head. The head quickly faded to a ring, but left nice lacing. The aroma is a basic version of what I had hoped for. Sweet fruit and candi sugar with a bit of peppery yeast and a herbal/floral hop note. Not bad, just doesn't wow me. The flavor is quite enjoyable. I get the yeast right up front quickly followed by the sugars and fruit (pear and apple). The yeast comes back into play again with a nice pepper bite before I get the earthy hops. Active carbonation keeps the flavor going after the swallow. Not too bitter, more dry and white peppery. Very enjoyable brew that I will pick up again. "
111,205644,Jaypeajus,6/8/16," Not sure what to expect except I look forward to coconut..looks ok, not much head retention, much darker than brown, but I'm new to brown ales. First smell is like a smokey bock, whiffs of chocolate, tastes of charred chocolate cinnamon burnt banana slight mintyness, smokehouse flavors but not much of any coconut to me, bummed a bit about that. Feel is viscous not much in the hop register leaves a smokey residue on the tongue and mouth. Overall pretty complex very drinkable but no coconut and I only bring it up cos the label says it. Oh it does say toasted coconut so maybe that's all the smokiness. First burn em brew and it was good. "

Nice aroma, possibly the best part of the beer, good irish malt feel, bourbon and oak plenty strong but not overly done. Smooth taste, relatively easy drinking, good bourbon delivery vessel. Mild roasted malt notes, dark fruit way in the back, not overripe, not bitter, pretty smooth, carbonation spot on. Good stuff, nice use of barrel in this one. "
124,206623,ivegot3Dvision,1/2/16," I enjoyed this more than I thought I was going to. L: Slightly dark, exactly what I was expecting. S: Light barrel character, caramel, maple, sweet malt. T: Dark fruit, light bourbon, malty, sweet with little to no hop flavor. F: A little lighter than I was hoping, but the base beer isn't very heavy (heh) in the first place. Just the right amount of carbonation. O: I really enjoyed this, I think it will age well. About the previous reviewers note about pruno: obviously you've never had pruno, this is very, very far from pruno. "

Quite strong alcohol on the nose...like pruno....smells like I'm in County Jail. Taste follows with a very sweet barrel presence. Mouthfeel is smooth. Finishes like a weak Bourbon....overall easy to drink. "

128,174137,JerzDevl2000,6/8/17," 11 1/2 years on here and never did I review a beer in a crowler, until today. Someone I trade with got me this a while back and I finally got around to cracking this 32 oz'er down on this cool morning. I'll give any brewery in my home state a go and for a first impression, this wasn't that bad. Not much information was given on the can except that Village Idiot was located in Mount Holly and that the ABV was 6.8%, and not the 6.5% listed on here... Nice pour to this, as the beer had a deep and hazy golden hue to it, with plenty of head on top to boot. Deep rings of soapy lacing were left behind as the head had a nice retention as I worked my way through this. Not a strong aroma to this but there was a good amount of honey sweetness present to draw me in. Metallic hops, citrus pith, and a grassy undertone all combined for an unusual, but relatively pleasing taste that was pretty full while making this beer seem more like a balanced Pale Ale than an IPA. A low amount of carbonation, spicy malt presence like bread, and medium body kept this from feeling too heavy though this could have been a bit more balanced! Just the right amount of alcohol in here given the massive size of this. Nice job on this beer as I'm intrigued as to what else these guys are capable of. Time to start canning and getting more New Jersey breweries onto the proverbial map! "

S: Sweet fruits with some candy sweetness and a nice floral hop smell. Not overly complex, but nice. T: Sweeter fruits start first with hints of pear, apple, orange followed by a deep candy sweetness and maybe some bubblegum. A nice yeasty spicy funk is tasted and then you get this massive hop hit. Tastes of floral spicy earthy hops linger at the finish and leave a nice bitterness. Not overly complex again, but very nice. M: Medium and coating with some prickly aspects. Nice lingering bitterness. D: High, these are really drinkable, and the abv is totally hidden. Overall this beer is a tweener to me, but a perfect tweener. It's hoppier than a BPA, but not as hoppy as a Belgian IPA. It really is a great beer that is really enjoyable. Dan, this beer is wonderful, I love it. If you brew it regularly, I will buy it. A damn fine beer that is a nice mix between a Belgian and an American that is very enjoyable and drinkable. Good stuff! "
146,58482,Sammy,8/17/09," On-tap at Mr. Goodbar's. Some yeast aroma. White soapy head on light orange body. Medium mouthfeel. Smooth, and spicey, corriander, a little cloves and pepper.A little bannana. A little hoppy and drying in the finish. An average beer overall, likely better with food. "
147,58482,Lexluthor33,8/17/09," A hazy,golden color with a really nice looking head and lace. The aroma of spice,grain and fruit/gum. The taste is sweet bubblegum flavor with only a touch of bitterness that is overcome by a good helping of hops. Some citrus notes as well. The feel is light to medium body with a smooth ending.Medium carbonation. Notes: Not Belgian,but still a very good beer. "
148,58482,jamie2dope,8/16/09," Here we go again, another brew from Weyerbacher. This one is a Belgian Pale, which is a hit or miss style for me. Clear orange in color, with a decent amount of white head. Lots of bubbles are racing to the top of this beer. Musty smells start things off and stay throughout, with traces of fruit thrown in here and there. More phenols in the taste, along with some grapefruit-esq hops, and a dry finish. Medium bodied, this is one crisp and refreshing Belgian beer. Drinking it is pretty damn easy too. Here we have another winner from Weyerbacher. Keep up the good work guys. "
149,58482,dogfishandi,8/10/09," MY 100TH REVIEW kinda wish i couldve had a little better beer than this for the 100th, but the next 2 should make up for it. pours a hazy glowing orange amber color. big fluffy head, almost pure white faded to a ring half way through the glass. just a touch of lacing. in the aroma your hit with big bubblegum and bananna from the yeast, some spiciness, floralness, from the hops i imagine. the aroma almost reminds me of the flouride u used to get from the dentist when you were a kid. for the taste you get some of the belgian yeast character, flouride taste, and then you get a lot of american hops. the 2 flavors combined create a kind of spiciness, almost peppery if you will. finishs a dry bitter spicy flavor that lingers. seems more like a belgian APA. doesnt seem to have the soft fluffy goodness of the true belgian PAs. for this i go down in the score a little, still a very good beer. smooth mouthfeel, medium body. good carb. but just not the same as an authentic belgian. good drinkability. "
150,58482,DanielClouser,8/9/09," I recently thought about the idea of toning down the bold new Belgian IPA style to a Belgian APA. I think Weyerbacher had the same idea, and Zotten is the result, as it is not consistent with the classic BPA style. Overall, it was very successful, but there was a pervasive grassy sort of bitterness in the flavor that really hurt the brew (especially its drinkability). I think maybe the hops variety used and/or how much is used for bittering should be re-evaluated for this beer, as it otherwise has potential to be excellent. "
151,58482,Patrick999,8/6/09," Pours an attractive shiny pale copper, like a penny. Copious bubblegum in the nose, some clove. I thought it was an impressive strong aroma. Nice flavor, a Belgian pale with much of the sweet bubblegum flavor, cut with a dose of citrusy American hops. A flavorful little beer. It doesn't feel as light and pillowy as a from-Belgium Belgian pale, but few American interpretations of the style do. Good beer. I wasn't prepared to like it as much as I do. "
152,58482,JohnQVegas,8/5/09," Bottle into Sam Adams Lager glass. Pours a hazy bright copper, just a bit on the dark side, with a thin, fizzy off-white head that disappears pretty quickly. Nose is nice - tangy tropical fruit and spices (coriander"), c-hops come though citrusy and pungent. Yeast comes through tangy and just a bit peppery. I like this one, though the northwestern hops tend to steal the show just a bit - they could be toned back a tad. Or at least made cleaner, their pungency is what's holding this one back. Taste carries more notes of lightly pungent c-hops, citrus and tropical fruit, big and spicy yeast note, peppery even. Light to moderate bitterness towards the finish that carries with the peppery, spicy note on the finish. Interesting, but the c-hops really take an overly heavy hand with this one in my opinion - give me a Belgian pale with grassy noble hops any day of the week. Not as subtle as I'd like it to be, but still pretty tasty. Mouthfeel is ok. The hops are laid on a little thick and rob the beer of the lightness I was hoping for, the body being a bit full as a result. Not as dry as I was hoping for either. Drinkability is pretty nice. When they say Belgian Pale Ale, I think they mean, Belgian-influenced American Pale Ale, not Belgian Pale Ale as in the traditional Belgian style. At least that's my take on it anyway. Still, not exactly what I would call a resounding success - not every style is made better with a big punch of American hops. Leads me to wonder what a classic like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, which isn't quite as heavy handed with the hops, would do with such a treatment. Compared to the classics of the style like Orval, though, this one isn't even close. "
153,58482,wiseguy142,7/30/09," Pretty good looking. Amazing viscous head, lasts a while with some quickly dried up foamy lacing. Not a big fan of the color.. sort of a stereotypical beer color but there's nothing wrong iwth it. The aroma is almost too much for my 1 unclogged nostril to handle. Sort of a pungent Belgian smell. I'm not a huge Belgian fan in general and it comes off to me as smelling like bleach. Otherwise very floral to sort of an extreme, like smelling a scented candle. The taste again follows the bleachy smell. Maybe I'm sensitive to this because some of my early homebrews had problems with phenols, but this is a phenol phuck phest. Sweet and tart around the edges with a hint of alcohol. You can tell the beer is bottle conditioned because it feels a bit foamy immediately when it enters your mouth. Drinkability not so much. I'm having trouble finishing this. I don't think it's bad per say. I read in BA mag that some people were claiming it's too young and I think I tend to agree. Never been a big fan of Belgian Pale Ales in the first place- the Belgians I really like are the Strong Dark Ales but I wanted to try this out. I'm going to save the rest of the 4-pack for a few months and try again. "
154,58482,hosehead83,7/27/09," poured into a traditional pint glass Big billowy head-Deep gold to golden brown in color Aroma-Sweet malt, faint hop aroma Taste-Definite maltiness with an underlying English mineral hop flavor and a Belgian ""tang"" throughout--Abit unbalanced for my tastes, a bit more hop infusion would have evened things up some, but upon warming the flavors seemed to meld together a bit better. Overall, not too bad and certainly worth a try. "
155,58482,TurtleCove,7/25/09," 12oz bottle bought as part of a mix pack from local beer distributor. Poured into a Duvel tulip, great looking beer. Deep golden honey brown, expected cloudiness from lees. Three finger white head, fine bubbles, subsides slowly to good lacing. Smell is as expected from a Belgian style pale ale, yeast, spice and citrus, maybe a hint of melon and banana too. Mouthfeel is nice, smooth and almost creamy form the fine carbonation. Taste, like smell, is as expected from a Belgian style pale ale with great yeast and a slight hoppy finish. One interesting, and very pleasant, flavor note is a slight herby flavor reminiscent of fresh dill. Eminently drinkable. "
156,58482,callmemickey,7/25/09," A: Murky pale orange-amber body. Moderate offwhite cap, little lacing... Not as robust as I expect from the style. S: Mild candied sugars, banana and yeast. Soft and rounded. T: More of the same. Pleasant, if not bland. Lacking in the depth to elevate to the next level. Mostly breaded malts and soft banana / yeast notes. M: Smooth. Clean finish. D: Easy drinking... overall the beer falters from its lack of sophistication and assertiveness... a solid beer nonetheless. "
157,58482,techcommdood,7/24/09," Pours a hazy dirty gold color with quite a bit of head (2+ fingers), and quickly reduces to a thin layer of light foam at the surface. Moderate lacing on the glass. A bit of a funky color, almost like 50/50 lemonade/iced tea. Strong malty nose with coriander, citrus, and peppercorn. Slight wildflower notes. Dry hoppy taste with malted barley, citrus zest, coriander, and a touch of black pepper. Mouthfeel is surprisingly mellow and juicy at first, but turns to dryness afterward. About average drinkability on this one. Overall, a good session ale. "
158,58482,ToddT,7/21/09," A- Slightly cloudy, pale orange/copper color with a two finger cream head. Head is sticky and leaves some lacing on the glass. S- Fruit, bubblegum, spice, sugar, and bananas. Mild in aroma. T- Taste is much more powerful than the aroma would have you think. Tart fruit right away, then a mild sweetness with spice follows to tone it down. This is quickly followed by an unexpected bitter hop bite. The aftertaste wavers between bitter, sweet, and astringent. M- Medium in body and well carbonated. Finish is clean but unusual with the lingering bittersweet tastes. D- Alcohol is well hidden and at 6% ABV it is pretty drinkable. I'm not sure if I would be able to session this one though. Tastes a little out of balance and not as smooth as I would expect a Belgian style to be. The finish is the flaw for me. Worth trying. "
159,58482,maximum12,7/19/09," Big thanks to AgeofQuarrel for sending this brew to Minnesota; I've been on the lookout for it & am excited to finally have this in my greedy, slightly dirty little hands (I was pulling weeds earlier). Pours an interesting pale orange hue, a bit like me when I've been out in the sun too long. A pass of the glass beneath my ass (nose) yields an interesting amalgam of the wheatiness of a hefe & the yeastiness of a Belgian. Interesting beer. The taste is a perfect mirror of the smell: Belgian candy & yeast, with a grassy, wheatishness that would be comfy in a hefe. Beneath the surface there are some summer fruits, & spices, maybe a bit of banana & cinnamon or something to contribute some depth & interest. Tart & dry on the tongue, with a mid-July taste that begs for a lawn chair & a copy of Frank Herbert's ""Dune"". Very good brew. Glad to have tried another Weyerbacher experiment, & a successful one at that. Start sending some of these north! "
160,58482,Nickls,7/18/09," (From notes) A - Very thin, pure white foamy head; burnt orange/light rust color S - Citric; yeasty; bit of banana bread T - Bready yeastiness; darker fruit flavors; dry vinous finish M - Medium to thinner; fine, subtle carbonation D - Just a touch too heavy in the body against the style for me; and the dry/yeasty combo just didn't really demand more from me. Not an overly complex brew, but nice in certain aspects. "
161,58482,cjgator3,7/17/09," 12oz bottle A- Poured into a snifter. Pours a orangish amber color with an off-white head. S- The aroma is pale malts with a nice fruitiness as well as some spices and yeast. T- The taste follows suit with some pale malt that is enhanced by a mild peppery spiciness and a touch of citrus. The finish is dry with a dry and earthy finish. M- The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. D- Overall, I enjoyed this one. I think it is a great Belgian Pale Ale that is definitely worth picking up. Recommended! "
162,58482,cvstrickland,7/14/09," Zotten pours brightly clear and brassy golden in color with a finger's thickness of grainy white foam atop. Steady streamers feed a slumping bubble-cap that retains at a thick sheet and deposits sliding lacing onto the sides of my shaker pint glass. The smell is sweet and fruity, with prominent peach-infused notes of spice-sprinkled sweet green banana. A light graininess laced with fresh-cut grass gains in stature as the drink progresses. The taste is mildly sweet and non-denominationally fruity with a wink of peppery spice and a stiff grassy bitterness that dries the finish. A mellow yeasty nuttiness provides earthy grounding for the profile. The drink is medium in body with crisp carbonation and is quite drinkable. "
163,58482,LilBeerDoctor,7/11/09," Reviewed on 06/22/2009. On draft. Pours a cloudy orange with a small head. Aroma is heavy, sweet, and lots of melon. Flavor of sweet hops initially with tropical fruits, bready malt (corn") and melon and yeast in the finish. Not bad but I wasn't a fan of the aroma. "

Smell: Some bubblegum and banana phenols with a spicy yeast and pale malt. Taste: Loads of delicious bubblegum and banana notes...is this a pale ale or a wheat beer!!! Nice belgian yeast with some spicyness to it. Earthy yet a touch sweet. Mouthfeel: Medium body with a nice amount of carbonation. Drinkability: Tasty and only 6% abv I was pleasantly surprised by this one and will try it again sometime. "
170,58482,Slatetank,7/9/09," I picked this up at Thirsty's in East York, PA. Poured chilled into a goblet. A - Dark honey amber w/ a pale 2 finger cap w/ a fine bead. Subtle lacing and a film remains when the head settles. S - Slightly phenolic aroma w/ spice and fruit notes in equal measure w/ a Belgian yeast nose that has slight banana esters M - Mild spiciness w/ mild carbonation and slightly bitter feel w/ a dry finish T - A mild hop is nestled under a spiced yeast flavor w/ mild tropical fruit note from the yeast w/ a gentle sweet flavor from the malt. A light biscuit influcence is tasted toward the end D - A good belgian pale, but a flavor that didn't wow me. I wish it had mor malt & hops than yeast. The drinkability was average to me, I would try it again if I saw it on tap. "
171,58482,Pencible,7/8/09," This poured a hazy copper color with fluffy light tan head. It smelled like fresh wheat and wild yeast and lemon hops, with candi sugar and salty cloves and earthy caramel. It tasted like sour lemon and wild yeast, with copper and caramel and fresh wheat, along with a bit of coriander and clove. It was fairly thin with moderate carbonation, and had a mild sour aftertaste. Overall this had a nice clean taste that started out a bit overly sour, but became richer and smoother as it warmed. It had a nice balance of spices, and decent body, so it was easy to drink. It seems like not many Belgian ales are offered for under 7% ABV anymore, but this one is a solid option. "
172,200826,ShanePB,11/30/15," Served on draft at Spring House Brewing Co. Reddish pink colored body with a quickly dissipating head. No lacing or retention. Aromas of cranberry, oak, white wine and sourness. Flavor is a bit more muted with the fruit flavor than the nose would lead you to believe. Delicate hints of cranberry along with a wash of sourness. Not much wine on the taste, either. The peach version of this is way, way better. "

S: Rich dark malt base with a touch of the classic porter smell. Light coffee notes and a touch of hops. T: Dark malt, light roastiness, with a bit of the classic porter bite and a natural malt flavor. Light hops. Crisp and clean flavors. M: Medium body. Roasted malts give a balanced and slightly creamy feel. Semi-dry finish. O: Very drinkable and a good example of an American Porter. This beer is nicely executed.

Huge coffee flavors, slight chocolate tones, and a nice earthy finish; very nice roasted grains; just slightly unbalanced from the coffee. Went down quite nicely. "

178,259020,AdmiralOzone,1/30/18," Pours a murky apricot color with a small off white head that dissipates quickly leaving minimal lacing. The aroma is the highlight of this beer, smells of tangerine, grapefruit and marmalade. The flavor is very sweet and malty with hardly any hop bitterness. No date on this can but presumably fairly fresh. The feel is fine, but overall a beer that I won't purchase (but wouldn't turn down if someone brought me some). "
179,259020,Czequershuus,11/23/17," This beer pours a medium amber with an average head. The aroma features notes of pineapple, mandarin oranges, grapefruit peel, and caramel. The flavor is quite sweet upfront with caramel notes, followed by candied pineapple, overripe mango, peach, and a a burnt sugar finish. The mouthfeel is medium with abundant foam y carbonation. Overall this is a bit of a muddled beer, with too much sweetness and slightly off hop flavors. Decent, but not something I would get again. "

T: It starts with a light prickle on the tongue, tropical fruit, green tea, and lightly sweet fruit up front.

The CANQuest (tm) CANtinues with this N2 CAN. From the CAN: ""The Can That You Shake!""; ""Keep Me Ice Cold""; ""Get Whipped[:] 1[)] Gently Shake the Can to Activate Nitrogen. 2[)] Open Then Invert Can Over Your Glass And Pour Hard."" I had kept it cold, but I read in several places that agitation led to gushing so I erred on the side of caution. My Crack! & inverted Glug may have been a bit less aggro than the brewers intended, but it all seemed to work out. I got a decent cascade that formed two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, deep-brown head with excellent retention, still hanging in as I type. Color was dead Black/Opaque (SRM =44), allowing ZERO light penetration. In fact, I thought that it might be sucking the light out of the room. Nose was definitely chocolate, but it was a dark/baker's/semi-sweet chocolate. This was no playing around, especially with its ABV. Mouthfeel was big, thick & full, like a dollop had been scooped onto my tongue. The taste was rich and chocolaty, but really smoky and bitter. Whew! Finish was definitely dry and bitter, but with a lingering chocolate aspect. "

A: Black body with 2-finger medium beige head with staying power but a little lackluster on the lacing. S: Delicious dark chocolate and medium caramel aromas with a little nutty note in there. I don't get much vanilla per se, but I think the intensity of the other aromas is heightened due to this addition. T: Flavor is a disappointment with a good blast of medium bittersweet chocolate with caramel sweetness but then it just heads to bitterness which seems off to me. The roast quality is too intense as well and does not work well with the above-average bitterness for the style. Alcohol presence is not heavy and there is no yeast character. M: Not as smooth as I was expecting due to the spiky bitterness. Medium body and low carbonation character due to the nitrogen. O: Decent beer but not a good value at all. I am not sure the imperial milk stout style works well but especially when the roast and bitterness is amped up like in this beer. "

The tasting notes had very rich milk chocolate, almost brownie battered flavored with a rich sweet malt backbone. Just subtle hints of sweet vanilla at the finish. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, very dense. Overall I find the aroma and flavors just a little muted, thanks to the nitro. Also more expensive when compared to the Lefthand Milk Stout. Still good beer overall. It really doesn't taste like an 8% beer. "

Light active carbonation. This beer looks like a huge, menacing barrel aged brew. Smell: The front of the nose is filled with potent bourbon and that familiar lactose sweetness found in many PW stouts. The barrel character carries throughout bringing oak, light smoke, and cherries on the body. The vanilla meshes so well with the bright alcohol sting. Lingering milk chocolate rounds out on the back end. Taste: Lactose sweetness filled with milk chocolate and vanilla hits the palate first. Barrel character warms up on the front of the body and continues to build slowly through, lingering long after drinking. Mossy oak meshes well in the body with the sweetness and chewy malt in this brew brings. Expected more barrel character after the aroma but more of the chocolate, vanilla, and lactose come through. Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is an excellent middle ground, providing rich heavy malts but being light enough to allow the decadent flavors to shine through. Carbonation is very light which really gives this brew the feeling of a dessert beer. Overall: Extremely impressed with this. I love that the bourbon characteristics in this brew are so familiar to actually drinking Buffalo Trace. A definite alcohol sting with perfect accents of cherries and oak are all too familiar. I love a big barrel character which this brew brings yet the vanilla and chocolate tones come through very clearly as well. Awesome. "

Smell - Straight up bourbon & cocoa. Mostly bourbon. Taste - Meh. The barrel overwhelms the base beer. This tastes like Jones Dog with a shot of bourbon added to it. Mouthfeel - Medium body, medium carbonation, dry sticky finish. Overall - Glad the bottle was free! Just another mediocre, overpriced beer from these guys. "

Poured from a 22oz Bomber, pours light orange/dark yellow with minimal head. Descent carbonation. Aroma is faint, smells like a mix of Columbus and Nelson Sauvin. Aroma is probably faded due to age of beer. Taste is fine, mild sweetness with a low bitterness level for an IIPA ( I would guess 50 IBUs at this point) Pretty smooth overall, nothing spectacular, however due to its age it taste more like a blonde Barleywine, I would bet good money this IIPA taste vastly different fresh. Please keep in mind that this review is for a 7+ month old IIPA. "

264,92616,Nugganooch,9/13/13," On tap at Aftershock Temecula, CA Notes from 08/18/13 - 4oz taster A: Pure caramel color body with ample clarity and a thin topping of off white suds. Moderately low retention efforts that slip away to just a thin film hugging the edge of the glass. Some light dots and streak of stick remain after each sip. S: Smells real floral with a twist of tangerine and pine. There is a base of caramel malt sweetness emerging to round out the nose. Pleasant hoppy aromas with a nice botanic quality. T: Tastes of floral hops mixed with citrus zest and pine resin. A touch sweeter with some caramel malt presence and bit of toasted pale malts. There is a light tropical flare coming in. Moderate to higher level of bitterness to the beer and a bit of alcohol coming through in flavor. M: Moderate sized body with a nice smooth texture. Carb is a touch on the lower side but does not detract from the overall quality. Nice drying crisp on the finish. Touch of residual linger. D: A fair DIPA with some nice hoppy flavors made up of mostly floral and citrus. A touch on the sweeter side but with honest balance. Slightly unremarkable but nothing really flawed. "
265,92616,DoubleJ,6/13/13," On-tap at the source itself and served in an 8 ounce snifter. On to the beer: It's amber orange colored and given a tiny head on the pour, leaving a few whisps of lace. This Double IPA goes down the route of a juicy IPA rather than a grapefruit or pine bomb, giving off nice tropical flavors which aren't too intense. Its alcohol is hidden as well, a bonus. However, like the other two Aftershock beers which I samples, has little carbonation. Good as it stands, but with more bubbles has potential to get to the next level. "
266,92616,Devinph,6/10/13," I don't know if I just got a bad batch or what... The flavor was there, however there was no carbonation in the bottle. I know if this was carbonated it would be a great beer. I have a couple other bottles from them. Hopefully the stout will be better. "

281,195387,Darkmagus82,10/16/15," Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance: The beer pours a deep orange amber color with a two finger head of fizzy white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time to leave a lighter level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell: The aroma of the brew is rather strong of pumpkin pie aroma with a strong roasted pumpkin mixed with cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar. Along with these smells comes some aromas of a biscuit smell and a little bit of earthy smell. Taste: The taste begins with a rather crisp pumpkin flavor that has a decent sum of roast and spice of nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice along with a little bit of brown sugar and caramel. As the taste moves forward the roast increases a bit with some other light hop flavors of earth and grass coming to the tongue as well. While up to this point there was almost no cream ale taste to the brew, toward the end, the cream really starts to kick it up; mixing with the roasted pumpkin nicely to create a rather pleasant, not too sweet, roasty but smooth pumpkin pie flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel: The body of the beer is rather thin with a carbonation level that is a bit on the higher side. I would have liked a little more body and a bit less carbonation on this one, which would have complimented the roasted pumpkin flavors nicely. Overall though, it was a decent feel I suppose. Overall- This was a rather nice drinking, non-very sweet, modest abv. pumpkin ale. The touch of cream ale flavor at the end matches the pumpkin flavors nicely and creates a rather pleasant drinker.

Aroma has fragrant notes of orange and nectarine and some pine, not too strong but very present. As it warms up a little more alcohol comes through on the nose. The taste follows the smell closely with the hop flavor up front giving way to a light maltiness midway through and finishing off with a nice buzz on the tongue with a bit of tartness and residual sweet hop. The flavor has a little white pepper to it as well. The feel is smooth and soft with a little seltzer. It is a little sticky on the lips as well. Clearly a great NEIPA. The tartness is an interesting take on it and definitely works well. There are many other NEIPAs I would be happier to have before this one but I wouldn't kick it out of bed by any measure. "

A foamy curtain of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and slight tropical aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that smells much better than it tastes. "
313,92616,mactrail,4/21/13," This pours a clear dark amber with an auburn cast. Not much of a head in the tall tulip glass, and below average carbonation in general. I am struggling to get much actual smell out of this, but it is powerfully hoppy-fruity in the nose and on the tongue. Rather sweet with a perfumey flavor along with the malt. Intense fruity hop flavor with some candy. Actually, it's really sweet. Dried pineapple and frozen apple juice concentrate. Some roasted malt along with all the caramel. With the right hops this could be an amber Barley Wine. Back of the throat scratchiness. A little woody and rather acidic with all the hops. Plenty of bitterness in the aftertaste. Here's yet another new brewery promising a full line of beers. They list 10 on tap already. From the 22 oz bottle bought at Barons Marketplace on Point Loma Blvd. I wish they would lose the yellow wax dip, but that makes it ""special."" "

Very slightly sweet malty and bready flavor upfront. Leads into a bold amount of herbal hops with medium botterness. Finishes fairly clean with a slight lingering bitterness. Tastes very fresh.

329,58482,ChainGangGuy,7/3/09," Snatched up a 4-pack of Zotten for $7.49 at Bullock's in Marietta, Georgia. I've typically enjoyed most of the Weyerbacher product I've had, so hopefully this'll hit a home run for me even if I'm not a sick, sick child dying in the hospital. Appearance: Pours out a dark, orange-amber body with a frothy, though somewhat short-lived, bone white head. Smell: Pale malts and light, crisp wheat malt brushed with a light, sweetish caramel sauce. Boldly spicy, zesty scent of fresh-ground pepper along with notes of Dubble Bubble bubblegum and citrus with some pine awakening upon warming. Taste: Pale malts and wheat coming across as a taste of particularly grainy whole wheat (but wholesome) bread. Light touch of sweet caramel glaze. Already there's a zip of peppery spiciness and flavor of bubblegum. Lesser hint of banana. Pinch of Florida orange citrus pith and a few drop of pine resin with a medium-plus amount of hop bitterness. A bit of watercress late in the taste. Dry, earthy, spicy finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-plus carbonation. Drinkability: Why, that's generally likable! Plenty of flavors and complexity to keep me fairly well-entertained, but, thankfully, it's easy-going on the overall ABV. I do look forward the three remaining bottles! "
330,58482,mikey711,6/30/09," Poured into an oversized wine glass. A bit darker than I expected as it was amber in tint with a thick head that disappeared quickly. It smells very earthy, but still has that bubblegummy sweetness in the nose as well. Also a touch of hop spice. I think i was hoping for a bit more sourness, but this was a good effort. It is earthy and and full of esters. The mouth feel is pretty consistant with th style but it isn't going to replace any imports in this style. Also, there is a bit of a soapiness which was a bit off putting. "
331,58482,jwc215,6/29/09," Poured into tulip glass: Pours golden amber with a thin white head that slowly becomes a patch. Some lacing sticks. Nice color, but doesn't have the head retention or lacing that I would expect. THe smell is of a sweet fruitiness and grainy with some yeasty notes. Slight tart notes are mixed in from the fruitiness. The taste is sweet and fruity - hint of bubblegum - that quickly turns to a dry, herbal finish. It it light-bodied. A few more effervescent bubbles would make it more lively, IMO. This is sweet and fruity/grainy turning (almost too quickly) to herbal (aspirin-y) dry. It has a certain character that gives it the ""American attempt at Belgian"". It's fine, for that. "
332,58482,GeoffFromSJ,6/29/09," This beer caught me off-guard in how good it was. A pleasant mix of Brett funk and hops. Brett on the nose. The taste is well constructed. Brett up-front. And then a pleasant and non-overwhelming hops bitterness at the end. I highly recommend this, especially for any Orval fans out there. "

335,58482,WVbeergeek,6/27/09," Appears a beautifully clouded copper orange hue with a thick chunky doughnut like cream tinted white head, has some yeast specks floating on board. Lacing is perfect fine Belgian style lacing evenly strong around my glass. Aromatics offer up floral hops with citrus components joining in, mildly spiced yeast notes with fresh baked bread in the biscuit malt department. Very soothing and delicious smelling brew from Weyerbacher. A superb blend of flavors collide with cookie dough like malt and sweet bread layers with yeast spicing the party up a bit. Finishing with mildly earthy, pungently citric, and pleasantly floral hop additions. A bit of undeniable Belgian funk going down brings it all together. A perfect blend of spiced bready hoppy ale sits in my glass very well done the most finesse to come of Dan Weirback in some time. Mouthfeel is so smooth carbonation bubbles to tickle a bit but overall the balance of malt and hops streaks so nicely across the palate, quite the interesting medium bodied Belgian style pale. Leaves traces of yeast spice and bittering hops on the palate, and hop burps will follow and tickle the nose. Drinkability overall kicks ass one of those OMFG beers that inspires me to try as many beers as I can. A case of this is in my near future I have to sit on these and watch them evolve, the best American brewed belgian style pale to cross my palate reminiscent but by no means a copycat of Orval Trappist. "
336,58482,OldSchoolGamer,6/25/09," I haven't had a lot of Belgain Pale Ales. I think the last one I had was Leffe Blonde, which I hated. Lets see if Weyerbacher can cange my perception of the style: A: Pours a nice golden straw color. Head is a bright white color, but dissipates rather quickly. Lacing is very minimal. S: Lots of Belgian yeast. Some fruityness. I also get a touch of hops. T: Pretty solid Belgian Pale Ale. First thing you get is the Belgian yeast. There is also some spice in there. Then there is a almost melon-like fruityness. The finish is grassy hops. Not bad. M: Medium to light bodied. Pretty carbonated mouthfeel. Very smooth. D: Decent flavors and mouthfeel. However, I think this is a one and done type of beer. Drinks easily, but not something I could drink a lot of. I was pleasantly surprised with this one. The Belgian character is there, but there is also a unique fruit and hop character that adds to the complexity and enjoyment of the beer. Definetly worth a shot, even if you are not a Belgian Ale fan. Recommended. "
337,58482,magnj,6/24/09," a - Somewhat hazy orange body sits below a generous film that developed after an initial 2 finger fluffly white head. s - Spicy Belgian yeast, way more up front than I was expecting, then again I don't know what exactly I was expecting. Inviting and sweet, missing the hops I was expecting but I assume that will come in the taste. t - Delicate hops flavor overshadowed by spicy Belgian yeasties. I was expecting a hop bomb from Weyerbacher but this is not it. That being said, this is a tasty brew. Sweet but not overdone, finishes clean and dry but the complex yeast flavors linger for a while. m/d - Nice and light though still a bit sweet like it's big Belgian Triple brothers. Much more refreshing but I'm still wary, I'm used to this taste having a sneaky alcohol punch to it in the end. Really drinkable, complex and a fun style I have not had much experience with. "
338,58482,NiceGuyMike,6/20/09," Dark clear golden hue with a lovely white, fluffy head with almost no lacing. This brew does not have strong smells, but there are some light fruity Belgian fruity sents with rather strong smell of of alcohol. First taste is a generic American Belgian flavor with spicy pepper and bitterness (a bit much too) to follow. A wonderful Bready flavor follows the spice. Oddly the alcohol flavors are well controled. Medium body with some nice effervecance which highlights the pepperiness. I like the breadyness of this beer. "
339,58482,fav920,6/20/09," Not a pro with belgian pale ales, but i like this a lot. If you've had Quad by Weyerbacher (which I love), this tastes like a ""Quad Light"". I will buy this again, and paid $7.75 for a 4pk at Jonathon Ron in Brielle, NJ. Another quality beer by Weyerbacher! "
340,58482,roan22,6/19/09," Had this on draft at the Devils Den. appearance: nice golden color, very fresh aroma: belgian yeast, fruity sweetness taste: overly sweet, seems like it should be dryer. sweet belgian taste dominates..I do note hops too but they aren't bitter enough to cut the sweetness for me. kind of banana in the finish which turns me off. mouthfeel is alright, except the banana taste! drinkability: no, I'll pass. too sweet for me. "
341,58482,BirdFlu,6/19/09," Pours a copper-amber color with foamy off-white head. I was expecting it to be cloudier for some reason, nice head, though. Aroma is bready, citrusy with lemon zest and orange peel, a bit yeasty and certainly tons of banana and clove. So kind of typical. for your spiceir belgian pales.. Taste is pretty much same as aromas, yeasty, spicery with black pepper, etc. I would like it a bit sweeter. Mouth is moderate, fairly spicey with a peppery aftertaste/feel in the back of the throat. Overall its lighter in body and sessionable in that sense. The flavor is a bit off, though, and the spice is a bit much. I would enjoy it more with a bit more sweetness. "
342,58482,BigMike,6/19/09," Pours a cloudy yellow with pale white fizzy head. Smell is very yeasty and grainy. Some citrus and hops and a touch of floral. Taste is the same. Lot's and lot's of yeasty sweetness. A touch of grapefruit and a slight hoppy finish. Thin mouthfeel. Not overly carbonated. Easy to drink. The thing that gets me about this ine is that it's a session beer that comes in a 4-pack. Good summer brew though. Probably not one i will try again. Not that theres anything wrong with it. This just isn't my favorite style. "
343,58482,corby112,6/18/09," Pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with thin foam white head that quickly settles into thin ring that leaves minimal lacing. Crisp light fruit aroma with subtle hops and apple, pear and citrus notes. There's also some nice citrus/lemon zest and peppery spice in the nose. Earthy hop flavor balances out light crisp fruit notes. Hints of apple, citrus peel, lemon zest and other peppery spices. Medium bodied that is smooth and easy drinking with a slightly tart, dry finish. "
344,64319,metter98,11/1/13," On-tap at Venice Ale House, Venice, CA A: The beer is clear dark golden yellow in color and has a moderate amount of visible carbonation.

T: The taste is similar to the smell and has flavors of light malts along with slight hints of sweetness. M: It feels just about medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. O: This beer seems a lot more like an American Blonde Ale than a Belgian Pale Ale. I didn't get any bits of Belgian yeast in the smell or taste. "

A small amount of sticky lace is left on the glass. A hearty Belgian yeast aroma, ripe fruits, with an herbal, medicinal hop profile and a solid bready malt. Raisins and bananas are the primary fruit. An astringent, medicinal hop profile really cuts through all of the other flavors and took me a sip or two to adjust. A signature Belgian yeast flavor of banana and an adequate amount of spice blend in with the aforementioned astringent hops and orange rind. The finish is a strong, bready malt flavor, think raisin bread. A very creamy mouthfeel. Medium bodied with near perfect carbonation. They nearly nailed this one. Finish is dry and bready with just a touch of bitterness. A pretty sessionable offering, easily drinkable. Would like to see it in six packs rather than four packs. A solid addition to the weyerbacher lineup. I will definitely be buying this again. "

S - hint of perfume, citrus, and spice A - a strong flavor of banana and pear balanced with citrus and a clove like spice. A long-hanging aftertaste M - Smooth and creamy D - Goes down nicely. "
349,58482,vikingloki,6/11/09," On tap at the Bear Creek Grille in Macungie. I'm a Weyerbacher fan, I admire and them and usually love their big beers. Comes to the table in a frosty pint glass, almost a reddish color with not much of a head, probably lost in the trip to the table. i like the color, it's a ""light foxy red"". Smells good, interesting, yeasty, bready, hoppy, complex. Taste is not what I expect - there is a very unusual, but I wouldn't say bad, kind of 'zing' thru-out, my guess is it's the yeast. Beer finishes dry with a little hop smack at the end like an afterthought. The yeasty taste lingers on the palate and to my dismay does not compliment the beer cheese dip and beer bread. I'm kinda on the fence about this one, I'd like to give it another chance sometime. Maybe having one that's been bottled in a month might mellow out that oddish tase. "
350,58482,Hojaminbag,6/10/09," A hazy, pale, golden body with about one and a half fingers of off white head that sticks around for awhile, but doesn't really leave any lacing behind. The nose is fruity and a little spicy. There is a nice fruit flavor in there that I cannot really pinpoint as a single fruit: just take my word for it that it is fruit. Next there is a slight peppert flavor, and maybe a touch of ansie-like flavor. There is just a touch of bready flavors from the malt. Mostly a yeast driven beer, and pretty good. Mouthfeel is appropriately thick and full. Pretty drinkable beer. I think I saw some cases for less than 40 bucks; I might go pick one up. "
351,58482,tempest,6/10/09," On-tap for $5 a pint at Liberty St. Tavern in Allentown. Appeared a hazy amber with a short head. This is an interesting beer, but I get some awful off aromas that really kill it for me. Still there's a relatively big, hoppy flavor with citrus and mild pine, while the aroma hits me with dirt and cleaning solvent - not cool. This beer needs some work, but it's not a good beer yet. "
352,58482,woodychandler,6/10/09," An aggressive pour resulted in two fingers of rose-shaded head with good retention. Nose had a slightly perfumey accent, kind of reminiscent of Juicyfruit gum, definitely yeast-driven in its origin. The color was a hugely hazy deep-amber. The mouthfeel was full, thick, and bubbly with a very sweet bubble gum (think generic pink or Juicyfruit) flavor on the tongue. The finish lingered with that same bubble gum flavor. At 6% ABV and with its realtive lack of banana esters, I really see this as an alternative to Hefeweizen, which I dislike. "
353,58482,Birdiebeagle,6/9/09," Bottle Pours a clear goldenrod with a good off white head. The head is frothy and diminishing. Produces good lacing. Aroma is good like juicey fruit gum. Good sweet malts with a touch of hops. The taste is good. Good carbonation and a nice mouthfeel. Has a good balance of sweet and hop. Not to sweet but sweeter than hoppy. Has light to medium body. A resiny texture. The finish is good with a quality aftertaste. I love these guys beers. "
354,58482,ejimhof,6/8/09," About 7 0r 8 years ago I bought the Weyerbacher sampler case and sad to say I found it hard to finish. I swore I would not spend any more money on their products. Lately the beers I have tried, given to me by friends, have seemed much higher quality. I am happy to report that this may be the best beer they have made to date. It is hard to tell that this is not made in Belgium. I guess hard work and changes have paid off for this Brewery. As far as this beer they have nailed every aspect of the style. Congrats to Dan. And I am buying their beer again. "
355,58482,JoePetto,6/7/09," On draft at TND in Wayne in 13oz wide beer flute. This is not an attempt to create a rendition of a true belgian pale ale, rather it is a ""tweener"" beer bridging the belgian and american pale ale styles. That said, this is a really enjoyable beer regardless of style. Funkiness of the Merry Monks yeast strain hits first then followed by a nice amount of hops flavor on the finish. The beer is zippy with flavor and carbonation and extremely refreshing. At 6% ABV, this beer is made to session. "
356,58482,NJpadreFan,6/6/09," Weyerbacher- Zotten A- Hazy cloudy orange/brown with a huge thick frothy head. S- Spicy. Orange peel, grape, and cherry. T- Spicy dry cloves with a tart fruity bite. Cherry, orange, lemon, and grape really come out. Wheaty and yeasty. M- Very dry and spicy. A harsh bitter aftertaste. Overall- Good spiciness. Slight metallic bitterness is a bit bothersome. "

Taste: 'Light hops and dirty earth' were the first things that came to mind when drinking this; it reminded me of Old Style. Mouthfeel: Considerably light carbonation - rather flat, actually. Overall: Certainly not one of the best beers I have had, let alone one of the best blondes I have had. I had this along with Brouwerij West's 'Tripel' and was excited as it was my first time trying their beers. I don't think I will be revisiting this one. "

367,64319,beertunes,7/17/13," 16.9oz bottle poured into straight pint glass. Poured a hazy yellow color with over 3/4 inch of white head that decent retention and moderate lacing. The aroma featured a good grain base, had a bright yeast scent, and had a bit of spiciness floating around. The flavors followed the scents pretty closely, grain, spice, and yeast, it was a pretty typical flavor profile for the style. The body was smooth and even, with a clean finish. Drinkability was good, the beer went down smoothly and quickly. Overall, a nice little beer, but nothing special. Worth grabbing if you see a nice price on it. "
368,64319,mhaugo,7/4/13," 500ml bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. Appearance: Light butterscotch, thin white head, as cloudy as grandma’s cataract. Smell: I swear to god this smells like a skunked Corona. It’s that bottle that’s been sitting on the shelf at 7-11 for who knows how long and could not have possibly absorbed more light. Mutated, spicy noble hops. Terrible. Taste: Also tastes like bad Corona. Bad Corona that someone ran through a grain bed of pilsner malt and wheat. I almost could not finish it. Mouthfeel: Light body, medium carbonation. Overall: This brewery could not possibly ask more of me as a consumer. I heard about what they’re doing, went out and purchased a bottle of each, and will probably never buy anything else they make. I’ve been underwhelmed five times in a row. This beer may be the worst of them. I absolutely love the artwork on their labels, and the fact that they intend to rotate them, but I guess I’ll be appreciating them on the shelf going forward. "
369,64319,pauldevay,6/24/13,
370,64319,mactrail,4/26/13," A light and spritzy brew with a distinct Belgian edge. Pale hazy golden in the glass with a modest foam and adequate spritzy mouthfeel. This tastes a lot like the Swing Session Saison from Victory that I tried last night, though a little more robust. Still this is pale and light bodied with yeasty funk and more of a Brettanomyces flavor. A pleasant beery smell. Very bitter with the yeasty flavors, lasting long into the aftertaste. Quite drinkable and not overpriced. But very dry and hard edged. No trace of fruit or mellow malt in this one. Eventually this just pushes to the bitter end and I can't finish a bottle of this stuff, in spite of its virtues. From the 500 ml bottle purchased at Bottleworks in San Diego for $5.15. "
371,64319,RblWthACoz,4/11/13," Pours a clouded yellow gold with a decently thick white-ish head. Nice Belgian profile on this. It's been aging for at least 8 or 9 months, I think, so it seems somewhat mellow. Tones of lemon, though not obnoxiously so. Mild yeast and bread are also there. A nice easy drinker. Not too bad, and better than I seem to recall from the last time I tried this beer. "

374,64319,kojevergas,10/29/12," 16.9 fluid oz brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap acquired at Cap N Cork liquor in Los Feliz and served into a Uinta pilsner glass in me gaff in low altitude Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Cost was $5.99. Expectations are above average; I dig the marketing. Served straight from the refrigerator. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. A: Pours a three finger beige colour head of nice cream and thickness, and good retention - thought the ABV is merely 5.50%. Body colour is a pale yellow. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Transparent. Nonopaque. Sm: Fresh clean pale malts. Lemongrass. Lemon zest. Citrus zest. A clean appealing aroma for the style. Little yeast. No alcohol is detectable. An average strength aroma. A bit adulterated. Artificial floral notes. Artificial lime. A bit reminiscent of a crappy Spanish lager. T/Mf: Artificial crappy lime up front immediately. A clean malt and decent zesty lemon body. Comes off artificial and a bit syrupy. No yeast or alcohol comes through. Very strange for the style. A bit garbage. I don't care much for it. It's certainly not well balanced. Overly malty. Poorly built for the style. Dr: Drinkable but underwhelming and overpriced. Very forgettable. Beneath pedestrian. Why brew this" I don't look forward to trying this brewery's other beers. D "
375,64319,wethorseblanket,9/24/12,
376,64319,UCLABrewN84,6/23/12," Pours a slightly hazy gold with a 1 inch foamy tan head that fades to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and some slight skunk which is weird because the bottle is brown. The smell reminds me more of a foreign lager than a Belgian style pale ale. Fortunately, the taste is much better with malt, grain, yeast, and some spice flavors on the finish. I am also picking up some grassy and herbal flavors as the beer warms up a bit. There is a medium spice bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that walks an interesting balance of having a mediocre smell but a great taste. "
377,64319,Wowcoolman,6/2/12," Sampled on tap at Whole Foods with Brian Mercer, the creative force behind Brouwerij West. Pours a yellow-gold color with some head retention. The nose is a tad funky with some lemony esters joining in. The taste is refreshing with a dry, straw-like character and a slight phenolic finish. Brain is devoted to recreating Belgian flavors and I would not think this was a West Coast beer. The mouthfeel is ample and creamy. Quite enjoyable if you enjoy old world styles. "

A strong grass and floral perfume aroma along with a touch of melon. Fairly light yeast, phenols, and esters. T: Decently sweet with a fair amount of bread. A bit of citrus peel and spice on the middle of the palate. Lightly grassy with some perfume character and floral notes. M: The body is fairly light with a medium level of carbonation.

390,64319,jminsc76,5/3/11," On tap presently at The Library in Santa Monica. Pours a white frothy head atop a yellow, golden body. A highly effervescent look with pretty bubbles rising and dancing upon agitation. The bouquet is highly floral, with strong wheat aromas and mild lavender. More or less it's like smelling a White Orchard from The Bruery, though slightly less floral, with more wheat and yeast. Flavors are yeasty, much like the aromas, much like White Orchard, though smoother and with substantial meat behind it. It’s almost as if I am chewing on the wheat, with a highly complex, smooth, dry heartiness that makes it so pleasant. Which leads me to the mouthfeel, which is dry and ebullient upon swishing, and very clean. Overall, this is damn good, maintaining high drinkability both from its flavors, mouthfeel, and excellent crispness. Ideal for pairing with food (thinking a good salad with some goat cheese or a fish dish) as well as a standalone sipping aperitif. Easily could I throw back two or three per sitting. "
391,64319,DoubleJ,4/25/11," On-tap at Beachwood BBQ, on to the beer: Pale yellow in color with little head retention on top. The aroma is difficult to make out; it smells most like a barnyard. A little sulfur make way. I thought the funk would lighten up from there, but it keeps going strong into the taste. From the taste, I could close my eyes and pretend I was on a farm. In fact, it seems to resemble a saison better than a Belgian Blond. At some points it's pushing itself to being uncomfortable, though I find a way enjoy it. This is definately not for the faint of heart. "
392,64319,beagle75,4/23/11," Draft service into a long-stemmed fluted tulip glass at Beachwood BBQ. A: Slightly hazy, medium golden color with one finger of fine white foam head. No lacing remains on the glass, although a few submerged and clustered bubbles cling to the side. S: Toasted grain and clean but characterful Belgian yeast present a smell that is slightly spicy and herbaceous, but otherwise clean. T: Begins almost dry, with bright fruit consisting of pear and golden raisin alongside estery farmhouse yeast. Acidity is managed well, remaining restrained but lively. Delicate pale malt emerges in the middle as flavors of malt and yeast turn bready. The finish is mild and yeasty, seeing a tasteful and palate-cleansing resurgence of acidity. M: Thin to medium viscosity, refreshing on the palate, early acidity is not quite felt, with moderate carbonation. D/O: This is an unassuming beer of ordinary strength and intensity that delivers Belgian-style character in exactly the expected quantity. Comparable to Russian River Redemption, it lacks the extreme dryness and blanketing wheat-like quality of that other beer. It is a bit limp to look at, in a way that Russian River beers almost never are, but otherwise it makes for a worthy saison/single cross-over. "

Aroma is sweet and boozy, later becoming a little more earthy and woody at room temperature. Initially it's like sniffing a pour of Buffalo Trace. Taste has more nuance, though still plenty of whiskey heat packed in. Woody drying aftertaste, much like a sip of bourbon. Middle has notes of earthy roasted malt, toffee, caramel, toasted almond, dry tobacco leaves. Chewy and rich, but not without some sting and numbing alcohol. Overall a little more balance would be nice, though it tastes good. "

Next comes some fudgy brownie notes that pair nicely with he barrel notes. The taste is much like the nose with heavy vanilla notes paired with fudge and cocoa. The barrel aging has really smoothed the base out and has intensified the chocolate notes. My only slight issue with the beer is the body doesn't hold up to the big flavors. The flavors are there no doubt, but it is just a little on the thin side. Overall, I like where things are going for pipeworks, will be excited to see what other barrel aged brews are on the horizon.

As expected S - Smells of sweet vanilla with a hint of chocolate, but vanilla is more pronounced T- Follows the nose but the smooth bourbon notes are just amazing. A little closed straight from the cellar, but after an hour, this opens up very nicely. The vanilla, choclate and alcohol notes are well balanced at this point. Can't find much wrong here M - Fairly thick and coating, O - A very good version of this beer. Also had this at Fobab and it's even better than I remember. Please let this one warm up, its worth it "
418,178980,ajm5108,6/25/15," Got this at a local pub in PA across the state lind from the brewery. Couldn't find any info on the thirsty dog website about the beer, but it isn't their advertised as their normal berliner. The bar is a legit craft haven in the area so I trust it wasn't a mistake. It had a dry hay and orange peel nose, the tart is gentle but noticeable with the citrus carrying through. The big thing is that it is very creamy and velvety feel, with a vanilla orangcicle flavor, which I assume comes from the barrel aging. Have not had the regular Berliner from them so nothing to compare it to, but this version was excellent "

S: Pine, soapy, grapefruit rind, light citrus. Pale malts, that do little to balance, but can be picked out. Finishes with soapy, resinous, piny hops. T: Like the nose, piny and soapy hops dominate. Slick and oily. Very light malts. Finishes on the bitter grapefruit, pine side of the spectrum. Still fairly mundane. M/O: A medium body. It is almost impressive that this is not watery and thin. Not crisp carbonation, but a bit higher than some of the other offerings. Oily and resinous. Given the mundane character, not bad to sip on. A slight step up from the other beers I had. Though a fairly non impressive DIPA. "
424,47792,WillieMoe,2/9/09," One of the current cask conditioned brews available at the Canal St. Beer Works. Nice golden yellow look to it with a thin head, mildly hazy. Has a nice spiced fruit aroma to it, with the camomille sticking out, but also some coriander and decent floral notes. Has a solid citrusy taste about it, with the hop taste being fairly understated, mixing well with the spices. Has a nice full body and a solid bitterness. A nice solid brew, that is definitely worth a try. "
425,47792,IBUnit63,2/7/09," Into a pint glass we go. This pours much like a Belgian pale...1 1/2-finger head with solid lacing. Body is very light lemon-honey and with a little bit of cloud cover. Of course this is extremely floral, fruity and calming. The chamomile is definitely the master of this domain. There's a fair amount of tropical (and other) fruits here - cantaloupe, a bit of pear, too...and a little papaya" The hop bitterness can best be described as Saaz-ish...tight and a little piney. The chamomile has that nighttime herbal tea quality to it - it's pretty hardcore in a cask. I wonder if the chamomile lends itself better to a regular cold tap - it gets a little thick after a while. Palate feel is very sweet and tight, with a heavy wallop of bitterness from the chamomile husks. Pretty hefty. Yup - this is OK but I think in a regular tap it would do better - chamomile on cask is a little over the top. Interesting pour though. "

450,195,Noxious26,6/11/05," 12 ox bottle served in a mug. Dark gold/orange in appearance and slightly cloudy with lots of carbonation. Head is foamy and cream in colour. Lacing follows all the way down the sides and is still there when the glass is empty. Aroma is very hoppy with traces for fruit. Mouthfeel is medium and slightly fizzy. Taste is slightly sweet at the swallow then almost immediately gives way to the fruity (grapefruit/lemon) taste. Generously hoppy with a little malt to give it balance. Finish is long, dry and slightly bitter. This Pale Ale has a nice zesty bite to it. The grapefruit flavour isn't as strong as it is in the Cinder Cone Red Ale. Here it is more of a highlight rather than dominant feature. I think this would be well enjoyed by both Lager drinkers as well as hopheads. I wish I had more than just one to sample. "
451,195,nfo,6/3/05," Slightly hazy appearance and a pleasant, light hoppy aroma. The flavor is very smooth with mild hops and a bit of citrus. It goes down easy, with a manageable amount of carbonation - I could drink a lot of this beer. A good bang-for-the-buck that doesn't overpower food and even non-beer-drinkers won't find offensive, it's handy to keep some around. "
452,195,MrNuggets,5/31/05," Mirror Pond: Prime example this use of fine hop. Splendid sample with white foam on top. Delighting the snout seducing my taste; piney throughout divoid of haste.

453,195,JohnfromDublin,5/16/05," Tasted on Friday 13th May, 2005 and the bottle sampled was a little past its ""best by"" date. Nonetheless, appearence was typical pale ale colour with slight haze. Not great head retention, probably the result of being a little past its date. Smell was a nice, slightly floral and hoppy bouquet with some caramel. Taste was good even pale ale with a nice syrupy mouthfeel, and a nice tang to the aftertaste. Another nice offering from Deschute's. "
454,195,charlatan,5/10/05," Generally my attitude towards pale ales is one of bewilderment. Why drink a pale ale when you can take on an IPA" Remarkably I found myself in a bar in Portland which was bereft of IPA, but, realising that one can rarely go wrong with a Deschutes beer, I ordered a Mirror Pond. It was somewhere between amber and bronze with a slightly acidic smell which I wouldn't like to expand on since my venue was bigger on smoke than beer. The head was rather limited. This was rather hoppy for a pale ale (immediately I was glad there was no IPA!) and boasted the usual creamy, raisin flavoured Deschutes backing. They certainly weren't being stingy with the malt here. This was a well coordinated and very drinkable beer with a reasonable feel (lots of small bubbles). Perhaps I should drink more pale ale rather than IPA, but more likely I should drink more Deschutes beer. I find Deschutes to be the most dependable brewery (never a bad beer). Good stuff! "
455,195,misterscooter,5/9/05," Unfortunately, the bartender poured this with no head to speak of so I wasn't able to get much smell out of it at all. Just a light beer smell. It was a cloudy copper color and looked good despite the lack of head. It was a dry beer, with a lemony flavor to it. This beer didn't do it for me. I've liked other offerings from Deschutes but not this one. It could be the pour or something because I seem to recall liking it from the bottle. I must try this one again to make sure I'm giving it a fair shake. I did notice the higher alcohol content in this one, though, as it kicked in on me soon into my second beer. "

458,2018,biegaman,4/30/13," Elysian The Immortal is a fairly bright and clear IPA, the extent to which tiny, almost indiscernible particles of yeast become visible, floating in suspension as if in jello. This, however, takes little away from the beer's aesthetics. Its head, though not all that put-together, manages to paste flyspecks of lacing throughout the glass. Unlike what I've come to expect from the Northwest, this is neither very expressive nor very fruity. It lacks the juicy, bright, mouth-watering citrus notes of other West Coast IPAs (though some mandarin orange and grapefruit is surely detected). More so, however, it is a bready, biscuity maltiness that the nose picks up on. The taste is profuse with candied lemon and orange rinds. There are also ripe flavours of pineapple and mango. All this fruit, however, is balanced by a great deal of biscuity, toasty, almost butterscotch-like maltiness. It is simultaneously sweet and citrusy, and rather tasty. For those who can't stomach the intense, gum-splitting acidity of other American IPAs, this beer offers a more balanced, almost buttercream-like mouthfeel that packs little bitterness and even less alcohol. If drinking casually with friends, this has a good chance at being the crowd-pleaser. Elysian The Immortal definitely lacks the bright-eyed and bitter hoppiness of its West Coast counterparts, but it makes an enjoyably drinkable IPA in its own right. In another era it might have been exciting, but given all the offerings in today's market it's one that's understandably easy to pass over (especially given this brewery's own abundance of better choices). "
459,2018,JohnnyBarman,4/28/13," Single bottle from the LCBO - picked up a sixpack of this. Poured into a nonic. Light amber-honey colour, nice billowing head, good lacing on this. Unfortunately, there's lots of pulpy floaters in this one. I'm used to this, but it's still unappealing. Nose is malty, with light west coast hoppage and caramel. Decent IPA that I'd really like to try fresh, because I think the trip was not overly kind (or the time was). There's some nice tropical fruit and tasty cracker malts, but it feels a bit old, and more like an APA. Mild carbonation, a bit slick. I'll hold off on getting this one again until I can get it fresh, because it's pretty expensive in Ontario and there are other IPAs I'd prefer to pick up instead. "

465,54663,TMoney2591,10/10/10," Served in a pokal at the brewpub. Honestly, after the first few brews, my hopes aren't the highest they could be for this one. It pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of white micro-foam. The nose is as simple as the style generally dictates, with notes of wheat, corn syrup, and corn. The taste is pretty similar, though there is an addition of some semi-funked puffed rice in there, which is kinda off-putting (though not altogether offensive). The body is light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, a decently solid pils, nothing to write home about but very easily taken down. "
466,54663,sweemzander,6/26/10," 6oz. tap pour at Lucky Monk (A)- Pours a clear yellow color that produced a light layer of white foam. Some lacing present. (S)- A big dryness with corn husk/meal/honey sweetness. (T)- A light, but dry and lightly bitter corn husk/meal with a light lemon-ish fruitiness to it. (M)- A good carbonation level with a decent balance. Dry and a little fruity/malty; straightforward. (D)- A good representation of the style. Not a huge fan of it, but it is what it is. A good refresher for the summer. "
467,54663,weeare138,6/23/10," Appears a transparent light gold with a small white head that quickly fades into a tiny collar. Spotty bits of lacing falls back into the glass. Smell is of pils malt with some spicy black pepper and a touch of creamed corn present in the background. Taste is of the aromas with a lackluster flavor after experiencing some kick-ass pilsners in Chicago...not to mention, I live in the hot zone of American brewed pilsners in Southeast PA where the finest examples raise the bar. This just seemed very blahzay and plain to me. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, spritzy, and semi-dry in the finish. Needs more agression IMHO. "
468,54663,BeerFMAndy,3/22/10," 6 oz tap pour into an American Tumbler at The Lucky Monk in South Barrington, IL. 5% ABV, 25 IBUs. A - Clear pale yellow color with a small white head. Low retention with a foamy ring and small bits of lace left over. S - Crisp and clean aroma of pilsner malts, soft, mineral water, and a noticeable noble hop aroma. It all bleds well together. A light touch of yeast to the finish. T - Pilsner malts balanced well with the floral, light spice noble hops. A soft mineral water touch gives it an authentic touch. M - Medium-light in body with a soft, smooth texture and clean, dry finish. D - A solid pilsner with good flavor as well as sessionability. A good first beer to start with here! "
469,54663,emerge077,12/21/09," High clarity gold, average head retention with some random bits of spotty lacing. A little too clear to be a Czech Pils, looks more German if anything. Dominating grassiness from noble hops in the aroma, with some light backing grain. Firmly bitter and grassy, again a dominant noble hop presence. Dry, crisp, and clean. Little to no malt sweetness. Fairly thin bodied, but definitely drinkable. After sampling a slew of European lagers this week, this came off as much more clean/fresh, and genuinely refreshing to drink. "
470,195,chrisms86,5/7/05," Pouring with a nice lasting head, Mirror Pond is the definitive pale ale. Starts off slightly sour and finishes with the bitterness you expect from a pale ale. In the background I taste some hints of wood. This style of beer has never been my favorite but Mirror Pond is definately an easy drinker, good for just about any occasion. "
471,195,ElGordo,4/8/05," My fiance acted as air courier to bring me a sixer back from her trip to Spokane. I am even further indebted to this lovely lady. Pours a slightly cloudy golden/orange hue with a smallish gleaming white head. Lovely aroma of fresh, floral hops, some sweet malt, and notes of pine and astringency. Palate begins with light sweet malt, then the hops kick in. Nice, rich floral hops coat the tongue, with a pleasantly bitter hoppy aftertaste. Body is full and slightly creamy, almost perfect. If I had to pick one session beer for life, this would definitely be it (although maybe it would be from the beer engine at the Horse Brass). "
472,195,mjbrewboy,4/6/05," Tried on tap in downtown Portland at a very busy pub. For a pale ale it looked darker than I thought it would, looked almost amber. A very nice citrus aroma but the malt backbone of this beer seems to be too much as the beer had some sweetness that I wouldn't expect. Very little head retention with some large surface bubbles during the first few sips. Gonna have to give this another try someday to see if I just had a bad pint. "
473,195,IceAce,2/20/05," Twelve ounce bottle with a best-by date of: 03/22/05 Pours a nice bronze body with very nice clarity, capped with a light tan collar of foam with only moderate lacing. Nose needed much coaxing and finally revealed a mild hop aroma...but not a lot of it. Entry is clean but not noteworthy with a midtaste dominated by euromalt. Finish is Cascade hops, and not in an overdone sort of way. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, but all in all an acceptable pale. I'd love to sample this with some sharp cheddar. "
474,195,KoG,1/10/05," Orange-amber hue with a small head that leaves little lacing. Flowery hop aroma complements the malty profile that shines through at the end. Taste is very well balanced. Starting with a nice mixture of citric and bitter hops and finishing sweet and malty. Very nice. Goes down so smooth and at 5% ABV, it would make a very nice session brew. "
475,195,donnebaby,12/29/04," Almost hard to imagine a better looking pale ale. Clear, bright orange with tan/orange sticky and dry thick haze head. Complex nose, with some candy sweetness, sweet malts, alcohol, and a touch of spice. Taste is mild and well-done, not leaning too much on hops or malts. After having other, heavier in taste pale ales, this almost seems like a ""light"" pale ale. But it's still very nice. Small, clean after of residual hops and light sweetness. The mouthfeel is interestingly soft and foamy, which I liked, especially from an American pale ale, but I think in the end it lent it a somewhat watery feel and decided that I'd like it a bit firmer. "
476,195,HochFliegen,11/15/04," Pours a nice slightly hazy copper color with a thin white head. Little to no lacing. The smell was grape or raisn like. Nothing to strong kinda bland and that was after about 15 tries to detect some charcter to it. The taste as I was affraid was much like the smell. Seemed rather bland. There was a slight sweetness to it but not much else. A bit dissapointed since Im a big fan of many of their other beers. "
477,195,RedDiamond,11/4/04," I've drunk this beer on many occasions at taverns in Portland where I've greeted it as a class act. But the pint I drank at the Deschutes Brew Pub was somewhat less charmed. The color is quite beautiful: dilute honey with modest clarity and depth. It sports a thin head, low carbonation, and no lace. The aroma is light and plummy, and the taste emphasizes malt fruitiness with a wayward note of pineapple and customary bittering. Late addition hops make minimal appearance. Mirror Pond is a decent all around pale ale that's best found in a bottle. The draught version served by Deschutes has a plump mouthfeel and a companionable flavor but otherwise stirs little excitement. "
478,195,Brian700,10/26/04," This beer pours a nice dark golden color. It has a white head that leaves a pretty good amount of lacing. It has a nice hoppy, floral, aroma. Slightly citrusy. Taste is of malt and a small amount of citrus. Mild hop bitterness on back of tongue. Good mouthfeel. Perfect amount of carbonation. My friend sent me a few of these from out west. I wish this was sold around here in MI. This would definately be in my fridge on a regular basis. I guess I don't need to recommend it to anybody on the west coast. I'm sure your probably drinking one right now. Try it if you've never had. "
479,195,RenoZymurgist,10/20/04," Poured a rich deep gold almost amber ale with a thick slightly tan head that subsided slowly. The aroma is of fresh floral hops with distinct fruity esters mixed in. The taste is bittersweet on the initial taste with a clean cascade hop flavor supported by a sweet carmel malt but the initial impression is on hop flavor not bitterness. The absence of high alpha hop roughness gives credibility to the pale aleness of Mirror Pond as the hops are deliciously there but not to the point of being an IPA. The mouthfeel as with other Deschutes brews is great when concerning the carbnonation and carbonic bite but in terms of body i belive this is lacking but not of making this beer poor. Very drinkable but i like the black butte or quial springs for a session beer instead of htis one as the hops could become less distinct after the first pint. "
480,195,Thrasher,10/18/04," Good ol' Mirror Pond -- it's available literally EVERYWHERE in Portland. Every bar, every grocery store, every 7-11 and Plaid Pantry... luckily, it's a good beer and deserving of its popularity. It, along with Sierra Nevada, may be the premier American-style pale ale, or at least the West Coast version. It's full of malt, full of hops, well balanced and drinkable, but manages to pack a slight punch. The mouthfeel is smooth and filling. I don't know if the beer is bottle-conditioned but it feels like it. Pours a tawny orange with great head and lace; hops dominate the flavor with fruit flavors that marry well with the sweet malts. Despite the bitterness, the finish is on the sweet side, and soft fruit flavors linger, such as peach or mango. It is an everyday brew, although for an ordinary beer it is lucky that we have one as tasty as this. Many cities have to make do with Bud or Coors. It may be a drawback to some that it absolutely must be poured into a glass; it just doesn't work from the bottle. A beer not to be overlooked. "
481,195,carln26,9/30/04," This was another beer I really wanted to try while in Denver. We dont get Deshutes in Boston (that I know of, so I jumped at the tap when I saw it. The bear poured a bright copper, with a thick full white head. A nice lace stayed for the entire beer. It had a bright citrus aroma from the hops. More hop character than I expected. The taste was light and fruity, from the hops, not the yeast, with a light floral middle. It had a light mouth feel and a great drinkability. Nice candidate for a session beer. "
482,195,beerceller99,9/30/04," 12 oz. bottle pours a amber hued liquid with a decent head that quickly fades to a sheen. Has a very slight sweet caramel smell with a whiff of hops. Has a medium body, with a taste of caramel sweetness followed by smidgin of floral hop bitterness to finish. A very easy drinking, smooth beer - maybe too smooth. "
483,195,Boilermaker88,9/28/04," Presented in a 12oz brown bottle. No best before or freshness date noted. Poured into a standard pint glass. Mirror Pond had a slightly hazy light copper color topped by a whitish head that faded down to a small cap and miniscule lace. The nose had a crisp floral citrus aroma nicely counterbalanced by the toasted malts. The taste had a well integrated merging of sweet grainy malts and the acidic tang of grapefruits and lemon rind. Neither malts nor hops attempt to one-up the other; rather, they blend together smoothly for a well balanced flavor. The feel was medium-light and crisp. Mirror Pond Pale Ale is a highly drinkable brew that's perfect for enjoyment while camped out in front of the TV watching football (college or pro). Another great beer by Deschutes, one of the most underrated breweries in the U.S. "

485,142974,Nat1975,8/16/15,
486,195,BuckeyeNation,8/6/04," Bright rustic orange, pumpkin to be exact. The largish head is ecru in color, is moderately dense and is beginning to pit on top. It hangs around for a bit, eventually falling to a short disk with a ragged collar of lace. If anyone wants to know what pure, unadulterated Cascade hops smell like, have them take a whiff of Mirror Pond. Even though Cascade tend to be overused, I still love their bright, grapefruity citrusiness. The flavor profile is pretty evenly balanced with gently toasted malt and Cascade hops playing equally important roles. That's too bad really, since this would have been the perfect beer to let those hops go a little crazy and show what they're capable of. Of course as a self-avowed hophead, I could hardly be expected to feel otherwise. The understated sweetness from the malt and the gentle bitterness from the hops makes this beer as easy drinking as any APA that you're likely to run across. The body is medium for the style, but has a disturbing habit of fading into a slight wateriness at the finish which prevents the agreeable flavor from lingering as long as it might. Men's Journal recently stated that Mirror Pond Pale Ale is America's Best Beer. Hardly, but it is a fine, drinkable example of the American Pale Ale style. Most everyone should enjoy this fine ale from one of the Pacific Northwest's best breweries. I know that I do. "
487,195,RoyalT,7/21/04," Appearance  The body here was solid brown in color with a decent head from a very careful pour by the bartender. Smell  The citrus and soft pine hops gave way to a stiff malt balance. The toasted malts were unsweetened and, I thought, a bit heavy-handed. Taste  The hops from the nose find their way into the taste, but its the malt flavor that dominates. It is a rather darkish malt not unlike raw molasses. I would have liked to have seen a bit more balance to this one. Mouthfeel  This one is medium-bodied, lightly carbonated, and has just a bit of a dry finish at the very end. Drinkability  This went down well enough. "
488,195,beertaster13,6/28/04," This should become a blueprint for all other pale ales. Pours an amber orange with a semi white/tan head that grows to great proportions then fades to about an inch. The smell is of strong floral and citrus, hints of hops characteristics, very clean and refreshing. The taste is a nice balance of the sweetness of the floral/orange citrus and the bitter tangy lemon hops. Some pine notes detected as well, very light and refreshing. Goes down about as good as a beer can, great for those thirst quenching moments. This is now become my staple in the fridge. Sorry SNPA for there is a new pale ale king. "
489,195,Rastacouere,6/23/04," Clear orange-amber, bright white 1cm foam. Light fresh orange zest fragrance with caramelic malt underneath. Hop profile is grassy. Honey and earth notes. Taste is fresh with earthy oranges peaks, peaches-like malt and what I found to be mostly grassy in the aroma here appears mostly floral and minty. Very quaffable straightforward verison of the style. Definitely doesnt have the complexity or stand-out characteristics to be worth seeking, but pleasant enough to try if you have the chance. Great creamy mouthfeel, airy and foamy medium body. Thanks to skyhand for the bottle! "
490,195,tavernjef,6/1/04," Chill hazen dark yellow with a slight bronzed tone to its body, thin dense white foamy top reached a finger high before fading quickly down to whispy fringe and thin collar, lacing in spots and tiny strings. Aroma is of Cascade hops moslty, grassy and floral, yet sweet with some fruity notions of malts inbetween. Taste intially hoppy with slight citrus and grass, fades off to a sweet middle of bready thick malts then dries out to a lingering bittersweet hoppiness that keeps a touch of zing on the tongue. Good finish with lingering hop spice and resin oils sticking well but light and nonabrasive. Feel is close to a medium body, albiet somewhat on the lighter side, still has some creamy, slick and quiet carbonation, and a dry, slightly spicey hop finish. Very drinkable, very soothing, a bit on the malty side, but the hops partake a good balance in its finish to make up for it. "
491,195,Redrover,5/12/04," I had this on tap in Federal Way, WA. The beer was a nice copper with a decent white head and very nice lacing. The nose on this beer is mainly from the hops. Nice pine & floral notes. There is virtually no other aroma, but thats ok. The taste is right on for a pale ale. The hops are clearly in the forefront, but they are modulated by some malty sweetness. Im not sure of the hop type they use, but the beer had a slightly piney taste with hints of underlying fruit. The beer seemed well balanced with just enough malt to balance. Easy drinking beer with a very soft feel in the mouth. "
492,195,garthwaite,5/8/04," Clear amber with a thick off-white frothy head. Aroma is pretty uneventful, though there is subtle evidence of some legitimate hopping going on here. For a pale ale, this has much more of a roasted malt base than I anticipated & I like it. Hop profile is piney & citrusy - just like with the aroma though, it seems subdued a bit, but does linger. Mouthfeel is medium to thin & a dry finish makes this highly, highly drinkable. Solid. Thanks to skyhand for the chance to try this one. "
493,195,krberg,4/28/04," Looks pretty much par for the course. Light copper with a white head that faded very quickly. Smells hoppy, but with huge sweet malt that reminds me of caramel. It starts out quite hoppy but that fades as quickly as the head into a nice malt balance which in turn fades into a suprising dryness. Extremely refreshing! Its mouthfeel is just right. Light with enough CO2 to lift the creamsauce from my tongue. Wonderfully drinkable. It must be amazing on tap and cask. I could easily drink this all night. Hopefully, this summer I will have that chance. Highly recommended! If I could get Deshutes here, Mirror Pond would be a summer staple. I purposely paired it with my penne and andouille in a pancetta and smoked gouda sauce (recipe doesn't have beer, so you can't have it). Perfect! It doesn't overwhelm any part of the sauce, yet it can stand up to the andouille and smoke and cut right through the dairy. "
494,195,watermelonman,4/10/04," This poured to a bright and relatively clear bronze and orange color. Its head was mild and faded quickly. It isn't leaving any lace behind as I drink. The flavor is snappy and comes with a good solid amount of hops. The mouthfeel is a little sharp but it is still very drinkable. "
495,195,goindownsouth,4/9/04," A big thanks to weefisheads for allowing me to sample this fine, fine brew. A solid-looking pale ale out of the bottle, this brew oozed from its 12 ounce bottle a somewhat hazy golden color. The aroma was clean and clear, with serious noted of cascade hops and some citrus sweetness to boot. A nice combination of bread, hops and sweetness in the flavor as well. A fine plae ale, and one that I would not hesitate to have again! Zum wohl! "

T - A unassuming malt base, thicker than some IPAs, bitter end not too strong, definitely lets the NW hops shine with a aromatic hop side to the balance. Dry. Flavors are blended well but this also keeps it from standing out. . Finish - Bitter tastes fades and floral, aromatic flavors are there to savor. M - Good body. Fine, clean carbonation that isn't too bright and gentle on the mouth. O - Very drinkable. More enjoyable than IPAs that seem to shout out their hoppy flavors to loudly. Loved the mouthfeel and felt like I could go right into having another. All of the flavors meld well on this one with a slight lean toward a NW hop character coming out front. "

510,2018,ChugMan,3/22/13," Food Pairing - Tacos: cheddar cheese, spicy tomatoes, rice, avacado, black beans in flour tortilla. Nice for the most part, the beer cut right through the spice and salt with ease. Probably would have tasted better overall if I'd not used canned tomatoes. A - Hazy yellow/gold, some debris floating in it. I don't think there was sediment, is my glass not clean" Frothy, uneven head left some incredible, sea-foam-esque lacing. Looked cool. S - Light citrus/ tropical aromas. Smells thick and bold. T - Bitterness punches right up front and continues throughout, one long blast. Impressive, but seems unwieldy, unbalanced. Fruity, sweet, finishes light with some citrus rind in the back of the mouth. Faint nose of sweetroll, with doughy, caramely notes. M - Light and refreshing. Clean, excepting the hops which are a little too big and dull for my tastes. O - Bit of a tough call, but ultimately I need to call this one just shy of remarkable. Doesn't mean it's not a solid IPA, it is! Just not quite enough here to merit special regard. "

Spruce, some bitterness balanced against some sweet scents. T- Piney, surprisingly not hop-forward. Malty and sweet with honey. Spruce is still there though. Pairs nicely with this cheese.

522,195,WetCoaster,3/15/04," Appearance: Very nice golden honey color with excellent clarity. Pure white head makes an appearance, but apparently has another party to go to. Extremely fine and mild carbonation; almost looks flat from a distance. Very little lacing. Smell: Massive blast of piney, citrusy hops. Not much else, but that's fine with me. Taste/Mouthfeel: Not surprising, spicy hops hit the palette hard. And that's about that, folks. No real malt balance to speak of, and an astingent bitterness to finish. The mouthfeel is very thin and light, but the carbonation keeps it smooth. Drinkability: Nice hoppiness and super light body make this a session star; you can drink them like water. It's simple, poorly balanced and quite thin, but the excellent hop flavor and mild carbonation redeem it nicely. Works for me. "
523,195,MobBarley,2/2/04," Here we have a most delicious Pale that has few equals, in my opinion. Purs a golden orange with ample, persistent off-white head. Lacing is moderate and carbonation is slow and attractive. The smell is the best part of this one, and is hoppy and tart through and through. A warm, sweet alcoholic maltiness insinuates itself at the close. Taste is top notch as well, and is wonderfully refreshing. Crisp fruit notes are present here, as well as huge hops that suggest juniper and citrus. Mouthfeel is good and slightly oily. The carbonation adds to the complexity but does not get in the way. Drinkability is supreme. Quickly becoming a classic. "
524,195,woemad,1/28/04," Bottle from 6-pk purchased at the local grocery store for $6.49. Poured an orangy gold/amber color, with a moderate white head. Smell is of floral hops and sweet maltiness. Taste is mildly hoppy, with a little bit of sweet maltiness in the background. I thought this tasted good without being anything special. This is a nice pale ale that wasn't terribly special, but certainly not offensive. Certainly it's eminently drinkable, and not bad if you can get it on sale. Otherwise, don't strain anything to get a hold of it. "
525,195,jtfest,1/14/04," Nice clear amber with orange tones, small frothy off-white head -- very little carbonation. The Cascade hops are evident in the aroma and the flavor, with a tingly bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is somewhat syrupy, which makes the brew 'feel' sweet even though it isn't sweet at all. Very drinkable -- a nice pale ale. "

Aroma: Good hop citrus balanced with sweet malt. Slight hint of wheat" Taste: Good rich maltiness help balance a good dose of hops. Mouthfeel: Coating, but with a dry finish. Lingering bitterness is quite pleasant. Drinkability: My first real love of west coast beers. Thanks to Dave for making me try this one. Well done, but wish I had a fresher bottle. "

The aroma is bursting with citrus and sweet malts. Fruit and a touch of caramel are present. The taste has citrusy hops from start to finish. The body is thin to medium but has enough taste that its complex and good. A slight bready flavor is there also in the finish. I really liked this beer and hope to score more of it somehow here on the east coast. I've been told its better on tap and on the west where its fresh. "
529,195,Gusler,10/19/03," Draught @ Papago A translucent amber on the pour with a modest and creamy head that is light tan in color, the left over lace forms a fine concealing sheet upon the glass. Nose is rich in malt, crisp and clean, maybe even a tad lemon like sweet start with a moderate feel to the palate. Finish benignly acidic, the hops pleasant and welcoming in their spiciness, dry and long lasting aftertaste, a damn good session beer. "
530,195,alexgash,9/19/03," Light copper body with a sticky off-white head. Surprisingly aromatic; big fruity malts, and lots of resiny hops. Taste... the malt presence is a little more subdued than the smell led me to believe. It's a bit toffeeish, but this is walloped by a large dose of PacNW hops. A little unbalanced I believe. Finish is dry, appetizingly bitter, with lingering apple cider notes. "
531,195,Gueuzedude,9/9/03," This beer is a wonderful copper color, quite clear as well. Pours with a cream colored head. The aroma has hints of lychee and grapefruit, definitely an American hop signature here. Quite malty tasting with a nice hop flavor that hits the tongue up front. This beer finishes with a slight bitterness. It seemed to be missing the American hop punch that the aroma promised, other than this quite an enjoyable beer. "
532,195,BeerResearcher,9/4/03," Theres a fine line between some Pale Ales and IPAs, and this is certainly the case with Mirror Pond. I tried this brew 6 years ago and it's the same today as it was then. Amber/copper in color, fast fading white head and some patches of sticky lace. A good floral hop aroma dominates a faintly sweet malty smell. There's a fair amount of malty body in this brew. A lemony citrus and lightly spicy hop bitterness possess quite a potent tangy bite. It mellows out and becomes more balanced at around the halfway point. Nice bottle! Thanks to Genaro for bringing this back from his trip to Oregon! "
533,195,putnam,8/28/03," Mint bubble gum and cream aromas rise up reluctantly from the orange/brown liquid. Grapefruit, alcohol and crushed seeds appear in the flavor. A leaner malt profile here, barely able to support the bitter, grapefruit-skin hop notes. Perhaps not the result of an obsession with quality, but the thing does drink. A little more roast, some funkier yeast, and you have Bell's. For fans of the craft Pale scene, maybe a clever little brew. For me, I can live without it. "
534,195,brakspear,8/14/03," Deep golden color, with a moderate soft white head. Aroma is malty with a brisk blast of Pacific Northwest citrusy hops. Refreshing and tasty, the malt body is clean tasting with a slight nutty flavor rounded out with a nice finishing hop bitterness. A very enjoyable pale ale. "
535,195,beerguy101,8/9/03," Dark gold color, medium head. Aroma is malty and fruity. Malts are nutty and sweetish. Hops are grapefruity. Heavily hopped, roasted malts. Nice smooth malt flavor. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Malt flavor dominate this brew. A nice bottle conditioned pale ale. "
536,195,arizcards,8/6/03," Had this nice little brew while in Portland recently. Pretty average in appearance and smell as this may have been on tap too long. However the taste was extremely good, something I am starting to expect from Deschutes Brewery. Had a good mouthfeel to it, good play between the malts and hops. This is another extrely drinkable beer from this brewery, makes me want to abandon the desert as I do not think this is available in Arizona! "
537,195,GreenCard,7/12/03," Appearance: (on hard pour) a pretty thick stand of off-white bubbly head which slowly compacts, copper color, slight haze Aroma: caramelly, slightly grapefruity hop, some unripe pear esters Flavor: initial caramel-coated fruit (apple" plum") sweetness, a round gentle flavor, mellow cascade flavor comes in, gradually followed by a subdued bitterness, some graininess along with an even malt backbone Mouthfeel: medium-light body, gentle carbonation, smooth, easy-drinking, no astringency Overall Impression: On par with their Black Butte Porter, this is one of my favorites that I've tried. Delicious. No complaints at all about this one! In fact, I really like this beer a whole hell of a lot! "
538,195,Rumrunner,7/12/03," 12oz. bottle A very nice pale ale in many regards. Pours a nice straw copper color. Good strong foam head at first. It leaves little to no lacing as it dissipates. The scent is strong in floral at first with sweet malt. Then a crisp citrus quality dominated by lemon takes over. The taste also has a citrus hop flavor. Less lemon in the taste though. A good balance of malt and hops. Some wheat flavors find there way out as well. It drinks well with a pretty good feel. The carbonation is a bit strong for me. There is a nice dry quality to the after taste but I felt the after taste lingered too long for me. A very nice pale ale. "
539,195,PhantomVodoo,6/30/03," Ahhh, the beauty of cascade hops. A brownish, golden-orange color with minimal off-white head. Small amount of sediment. Aroma of citrus hops and toasty pale malts. Taste shows toasty pale malts balancing out wonderful piney, citrusy hop flavors. Finishes well. Good body and mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Overall a very good APA. Too bad this and Full Sail Pale Ale aren't available here. They're 2 great Pacific NW APA's. "
540,195,jcalabre,6/13/03," Originally sampled on 21 August 2002. Had this at Deschutes' brewpub while in Bend, OR. It's hoppy w/ a nice nose. The pour is a cloudy amber color. It finishes fairly well balanced. This is a pretty good American Pale Ale. I would definitely have this one again. "
541,195,Boto,5/22/03," This one pours a cloudy amber color. A bit of a head, but it did stay around for a little while. Fairly decent aroma of hops to the nose. Flavor is well balanced, with a fairly decent hop bite at the end. It gets high points for being crisp and clean. Not spectacular, but a decent Pale Ale. "
542,5586,drpimento,6/9/10," Flat beer stored under florescent lights at the store. Poured with no head and of course no lace. Aroma was skunky, a friend nearby smelled it right away. Color is a clear amber. Aroma also has the malt yeast and strawberries. Flavor is like aroma. Body isn't so hot being flat. Ditto with finish. Wish I could a had a better one. "
543,195,Delephant,3/30/03," I ll just get this out of the way, this is one of my favorite - rapidly on its way to my very favorite - Pale Ale out there today. The beer pours with a beautifully rich, cedar color, with a somewhat translucent look, but still full enough to show depth. The true treat begins when the first whiff is taken of the wonderfully sweet but hoppy aroma that radiates from the beer. The head is light, well colored for the beer, but loses strength rapidly. Thats OK though, I tend to drink these beers so indulgently that I fear I dont give it enough time to truely critic. ;) However, as the glass empties, a nice tribal pattern of foam grips the side of the glass, maintaining a pretty gorgeous beer. I love this beer. The flavor starts calm, slightly hoppy, however once swallowed, the tongue gets the true delight. The ""copious"" amounts of hops linger well after drank, and leave you thirsty for another gulp. My favorite part" Could be the fact this beer goes unfiltered, so a generous amount of yeast builds to the bottom, convincing you to finish each and every one opened to get that blessed B-12 rich hangover antidote. Highly recommended. "
544,195,freed,3/11/03," I most recently had this on tap, though I've enjoyed it out of the bottle several times. By the time I got the beer, most of the head had dissipated. The beer is quite a lovely copper color. It has a subtle, somewhat unassuming smell. Though its not that bitter, it has a very bright citrus bite to it that really makes it enjoyable. The body is quite smooth, and the malt body compliments the hop aroma well. The beer pairs well with asian foods, and with trivial pursuit, or whatever it is you do in the evenings with your drinking buddies. Another good Oregon beer. "
545,195,Reidrover,3/1/03," Bought this in the usual Deschutes 12 ozer brown bottle with raised hops on the glass. Nice simple label. The beer pours a nice coppery colour with some slight murkiness..very small head that doesnt last. very hoppy smell with some good malt following. This is a hoppy beer , which I like cascade hops in the taste this time ( many Deschutes brews use EKG hops)..nice taste though the hops dont totally dominate , other flavours do come through..the malt is there i also get a tart sweetness near the end of every mouthful..its pleasant though. Feels good in the mouth tingles the taste buds like most hopped beers do..good. Very drinkable a good session brew for those that like to tatse hops hops hops "
546,195,Fabric8r,2/18/03," Nice Pale Ale. Tap is a lot better than bottle. The 6-pack I bought tasted a lot more hoppy than I memember the draught was like at a local restaurant. I didn't like the hoppy cascade flavor, not when it says Pale Ale on the label. But, still enjoy it. "
547,195,feloniousmonk,1/12/03," Tiny head, near violet in color. Aroma: loads of fruitiness: strawberry, melons, raspberry, very tasty. Finish is swift, though, and body is weak. I'm becoming bored very quickly. Hops don't provide much spark on the palate, feels a little flat. Maybe it's supposed to , but I feel a bit let down. I did like Black Butte Porter, and Obsidian Stout, but this one did little for me. (P.S., Seven years later, I'm a little embarrassed with this review. Now that it's becoming prevalent in my hometown market, I intend to review a freshly tapped pint someday soon.) "

561,2018,StonedTrippin,2/4/13," one of the better straight up ipas ive had in awhile now. this one pours a lighter pale golden color, mostly clear, with a big doughy white head. the nose is pleasantly fruity, tangerine and some springtime flowers mix with a nice juicy bitter hop and rather delicate malt bill. flavor too features the hop unimpeded by heavy grain. not oily or resinous, but light and fruity and crisp, while equally fresh. the beer really pops in the mouth, like biting into a cold mandarin orange. its well carbonated and active in the mouth. there is so much flavor in this beer its incredible. not a big brutal bitter beer, but still a hop bomb, designed to show the other side of hops, a lighter fruity side that may be more approachable to newcomers to the style. I loved the flavor and feel of this, and have been in need of a new daily drinking ipa, and I think I may well have found it here with the immortal. its balanced off just right, but retains its uniqueness in the crowded ipa world.

Malt-forward aroma may be an indication of bottle age" Although purchased this week, can't find a date indication on the bottle. Flavour is well balanced, with caramelized malt sweetness transitioning into tropical fruit and hop bitterness. The impressively lingering bitter finish is a pleasant surprise. Definitely a beer and a brewery worth trying!! "

577,2018,stakem,1/17/13," Thanks Eric for sharing this bomber with me. Poured into a tulip, the brew appears a hazy light copper color with a frothy white head. A bit of webby lace sticks to the glass and a swirl revives a cap that displays some solid retention. The aroma is herbal and rindy with hop character. Some suggestions of cheese quality mingle with hints of fruit. A little mineral filled towards the back as it opens up. Not bad smelling by any stretch but also not that great either. The flavor is herbal and zesty with some rindy bitterness of hops and some cheese notes mingled with minerals and sulfuric components. There is lots of bitterness here from the hops and while its not over-done for the style, the flavors dont exactly combine to make anythibg terribly enjoyable either. This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is an ok offering that I appreciate getting the chance to try. Unless this was offered to me uber fresh, I dont think i would bother having it again. "

579,195,zacharius,1/12/03," This beer pours a nice white head that lasted throughout the session. I really dig the golden hue on this beer. The aromoa of the beer is very earthy and floral with suggestion of citrus. However the taste is so different that it betrays the aroma. The flavor is very bland with an overpowering cascade hop flavor--however this beer is has a less sour aftertaste than most cascade hop beers.The body is fuller than I expected and made up a little for the mild flavor. Due to the mildness I consider this is more of a ladies beer--my girlfriend really likes it. However it is not so bland that I couldn't knock down a few of these and enjoy it. "
580,195,aracauna,1/12/03," Pours pale orange amber with small quickly fading head. THe aroma is mostly hops, although not powerful. A bit citrusy, a bit floral. The flavor flip-flops being mostly malt. Ver bread-doughy, like multigrain bread. The finish is dry and short. The palate is soft. The beer is a bit thin in flavor for my tastes, but it isn""t bad. "
581,195,Mark,9/8/02," This fine offering from Deschutes in Oregon poured a nice deep amber. Lace was wispy from a decent head. I liked the hoppy aroma and while I expected a more prominent hop finish I wasn't let down. This beer was very smooth, refreshing, and drinkable. The mouthfeel was a little on the thin side otherwise I say go for it. "
582,195,sinistersteve,9/4/02," Nice golden, somewhat cloudy amber color. Head leaves something to be desired though. No head also means no artistic lace on the glass. The only good part of that is that it'll be easier to clean the glass if I forget to rinse it out. Good flavor that is both malty and hoppy, but not too extreme either way. Good beer, in my opinon, but I think the cheesy hop embossing job on the bottle needs to go. "
583,195,BeerManDan,8/6/02," Mirror Pone Pale Ale is Dischutes best beer. Not to malty and grainy, but has just the right amount of bitterness to bring everything together. The flavor seem to get more complex as it got warmer in the glass. "
584,195,beernut7,5/4/02," I think one of the best American pales out there. Many breweries stay ligth on the malt to bring out more hop flavor, but Mirror Pond has a great malty character to balance out the wonderful flavor of the Cascade hops. Love this stuff. "
585,195,ZAP,4/6/02," Heavily hopped...noticable on the nose and the buds...good fruity hop notes...citrucy...bittering units are much higher on this one than their other pale ale I would assume. Nice frothy creamy head that settles nicely...cloudy gold in color....tastes like it was dry-hopped....a spicy, fruity ale without enough malt backbone..decent and more adventurous and flavorfull than their other pale ale (Cascade Ale), but not as balanced. I prefer the other one (Cascade Ale) even though it lacks this flavor because I see this as a little unbalanced... "
586,195,Jordan,3/20/02," A very good APA. Overall well rounded flavor, Nothing outstanding it's ground. However, nothing particularly special about it either. What else can I say, but you are about to drink a very good APA" "
587,195,mattmaples,9/18/01," This is a GREAT americal Plae ale. I think Elk Baiter mistakenly pickdt up a bottle of nail polish instead of Mirror Pond. There is no way this stuff and be considered dry or bitter. It has a lovely rounded maltyness if anything a small tiny touch of sweetness. With a understated bitterness and only a small hop flavor. If you find it you must try it, it is just good beer. "

Smells of hops, but not overpowering - seems to have a bit of that cat urine aroma going on, which is certainly not a bad thing in this type. Also a bit of a grassy smell. Taste is great - tastes like the hops are near the fresh side, which I wasn't expecting, but is always a pleasant surprise. Nice maltiness to balance the beer - not overly bitter at all. Mouthfeel is pretty well balanced, but a bit towards the bitter side - obviously it's an IPA, so again, not really a negative. Overall, a very good IPA, with a changing character as it warms up - will definitely look for again. "
595,2018,Knapp85,12/28/12," This poured out as a really nice hazy golden yellow color with a nice soapy white head on top. The lacing is very sticky which looks awesome on the glass. The retention was decent also. The smell of the beer had some malt and a good amount of hop aromas. The taste had a very nice malt backbone with a pleasant hop flavor in there too. The mouthfeel of the beer had a good amount of body to it as well as a solid carbonation and a dry finish. Overall I really enjoyed this IPA. I would drink this one again. "

A decent amount of caramel with a little biscuit underneath. Sweetness pervades throughout. Bitterness is moderated and really takes hold midway through leading to a lasting film on the back of the throat. Alcohol is apparent, even at such a low strength. Mouthfeel is slick and sticky. Overall, I'm not really a fan of this beer. It feels a lot stronger than 6.2% and the sweetness really limits drinkability.

Taste starts similarly, some sweet malts, caramel and toffee, light reddish malts, fairly bitter as light earthy and citrus hops, candied orange peel, little flowery hop, slight tingle. chewy malt. Finish is a bit drier, fairly bitter lingering with little citrus, little sticky. Mouth is med to a bit heavier bodied, decent carb.

Medium body and carbonation levels, partially creamy texture. Smells of a fairly simple blend of pine resin, caramel / biscuit, and a touch of orange peel. Tastes of the same elements but also has a fair amount of earthy and green tea flavor in the middle of the sip. Not a bad IPA, but not exceptional either. "
634,2018,Aleforme,9/13/12,
635,2018,Hopfenpeter,9/13/12," Poured into a crystal mug, the color is a almost clear medium gold. The white head, about an inch high, holds up for a little bit, before dissipating leaving good lacing. The smell is of pine resin, some faint fruit, earthy hops and malt. Tasting the beer, some of the fruit flavor will start the beer, but is immediately checked by the pine hop flavors. Resin flavors and malt, and a grainy bitter finish leaves a reminder on the tongue. Medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Nice IPA. "
636,2018,joemcgrath27,9/9/12," A - hazy golden orange, solid off white head, retained respectably S - hop notes of pepper, resin, pine, with significant caramel T - pepper and grapefruit rind hops up front, more subtle resin notes, caramel and toasted grain malt balance, with the pepper heating up through the finish M - medium body with lower than medium carbonation, definite spicy kick with mild bitterness O - solid solid solid front to back, not a mind blower but a fine IPA with west coast feel of spicy and herbal hoppiness "
637,2018,Darkmagus82,9/9/12," Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass Appearance: Served a very lightly hazed golden color with a bit of orange tint. It was served with a one finger white head which faded over a moderate amount of time to leave a decent amount of lacing. Smell: The aroma was a blend of citrus hop, caramel sweetness and some more bready and biscuity notes. Mixed with these aromas was also a light earthy hop smell. Taste: The taste started out with a bready taste mixed with a very light caramel sweetness as well as a decent presence of some grapefruit hop from the start. As the taste advances further, the sweetness and the breadiness fades some and other hop flavors of a pine and light earthy nature come to the tongue. With the new presence of the earthy and pine flavors is an increase in the grapefruit hop flavor. While none of the hop individually grows very strong, tighter they create a nice hop blend. In the end, the hop combined with the now lighter bready base create a slightly bitter finish to the brew. Mouthfeel: The body is average in creaminess with a carbonation level that is average as well. Overall: A nice, but nothing exceptional IPA. Worth a try, but not one I would frequent with any great occasion. "

639,2018,bourbonbock,9/8/12," Poured a 22 oz bomber bottle into a clean mug and received the following. A. Beer pours slightly cloudy and golden yellow with numerous fingers of white foamy head that is receding slowly. I thing this must be slightly over carbonated but doesn't smell infected. S. Neverending hops with pine, citrus, and earthy coffee bean aromas. Clean solid aroma that finishes with a floral bouquet. T. The flavor starts off with nutty followed by a faint saltiness and finishes with a pleasant sweetness. Not an in your face style IPA that is all over the place now. It actually is very gentle giant. M. Light but makes it's presence known and leaves a slightly tangy finish on the tongue. O. Definitely wouldn't pass it by without a second thought but not something that I would want more than one or two of. "

Nose: Nice bright hoppy aromas with crisp citrus Taste: A nice lightly carbonated mouthfeel with sweet citrus and hops turning to a nice bright bitter pithy citrus finish that lingers just long enough to create a very thirst quenching and satisfying ale with all the drinkability to be a session beer...meaning I could easily drink a six pack of this on a nice hot afternoon and be right where I want to be! Salute! "
642,2018,ummswimmin,9/2/12," Poured from bottle into a fat tulip style glass I get about a finger of foam. The coloring was a vibrant yellow with a touch of orange. I get some particulate (from bottle conditioning or unfiltered nature"). The bouquet has citrus and a some frutiness. I almost got apple out of the throat of the bottle. This is a pleasant nose. The balance isn't great. I like the hoppiness... it is definitely present. I feel like it could use some extra malt to improve the flavor of the beer. This is a decent example of an IPA. If you run across a bottle, pick it up. "

Nice malty character on the nose followed by a dashing hop flavor that resonates in the back of your mouth. Very easy to drink, almost a bit creamy. Elysian is truly a west coast hop bomb that should be up in class with all the greats that come from that area. Hope to run into this one soon! "

653,2018,TheBrewo,8/21/12," We pour a brew of glowing solid orange. It holds a two finger head of creamy, off-white bubbles. This retains nicely, leaving spotty, patterned lacing around the glass. A big aggregate of bubbles covers half the glass. Carbonation appears active, and no sediment is noted, but a light haze permeates the beer. The look is just very frothy, with nicely reproducible head upon swirling. There are bright citric, nectary, and piney hops. These sit upon pale malts that have a light, buttery quality. They are also wet with minerals, and a bit salty and sweaty. Bright spice of mustard powder and a light booze are on the back with warmth. Sweetness is in the form of fresh red apples, with additions of those fruity, syrupy hops from the first sniff. Our first impression is that there is good bitterness to the prominent hops, but the flavoring is a little washed through. As we sip, metallics and earthy hops hit first. The grain is light and toasted, as in the nose. As we move towards the peak, the hops become more wet, juicy, and savory. We finish on a slightly watery note, with herbal hops, light booze, watery grain, and a bittering lemon zest The aftertaste is fusel with booze, citric and soapy hops, sour malts, and light toast. The body is medium, and the carbonation is medium, lightly prickling the mouth. There is nice froth, slurp, sip, and cream, but the mouth is ultimately dried with a tannin-like streak. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks easily. Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the many faces taken on by the hops. Additionally, this was an absolutely beautiful beer, both in color and froth. From the nose, to each section of the tasting we were given a different hop varietal. Unfortunately, the flavoring is a little watered down at the end of the sip, so this takes away from the robustness of each sip. "

658,2018,jjboesen,8/13/12," Brewed in Seattle, America's grunge Capitol, the Immortal opens in an adequate flash of froth; the head is a shimmery marshmellow cap that tops a translucent amber body, within a furious school of carbonation bubbles. The nose detects some subtle whiff of peach while the palate is underwhelmed with what can best be described as a hop mouthwash. (The palate doesn't have much to do here.) However, there is a substantial body to boast about - but that's it for that. When in Seattle, I always try to stop by the brewpub; good thing, as their beers don't seem to travel well. "

Aroma is good NW citrusy hops. Taste follows nose: juicy, citrusy hops that lean toward orange or tangerine, dry biscuity malt that holds the beer together but takes a backseat to the hops. A sharp hoppy bite on the finish. Everything I look for in a NW style IPA. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy with a crisp, refreshing finish. Overall a really tasty, solid beer. I could drink this all day long. "
663,2018,oriolesfan4,7/31/12," Pours a nice, cloudy golden color with a pretty good head to it. Nice floral aroma on this one. Good mouthfeel, finally a well balanced IPA after going through a few off-kilter ones. Sweet bitterness of piney and citrus balanced by some maltiness for once. A pretty good IPA, not in the upper echelon but a solid NW stab at the style. "
664,2018,JWU,7/30/12," poured from a 22oz. bottle into a tulip glass. A- a clear orange/gold, with a finger and a half of eggshell head. Nice lacing down the glass S- Big toffee/caramel malt notes, with a grapefruit, slightly earthy hop presence. Smells A LOT like Great Divide Titan. T- Best way I can describe it is a baby of Great Divide Titan. The taste is much more restrained though. Fairly prominent toffee/caramel malts, with a grapefruity hop (Amarillo") and slightly tangerine note (Centennial"). M - Medium carbonation, and medium bodied. There's a slight astringency on the back end that I don't really care for. O- It's good, but not ""world beater"" good. "
665,2018,kylehay2004,7/29/12," A: 1.5 finger frothy head with floating debris on a crimson and golden body. S: honey, grapefruit and apple citrus, caramel malt, spices. T: very bland and almost one dimensional as the flavor stays the same throughout with toasted caramel malts, bitter earthy hops and light citrus presence. M: medium body and moderate carbonation. Overall: not a very complex beer. flavors are mild and are too bitter to be considered blanced. "
666,2018,nickfl,7/29/12," A - Pours with one and a half fingers of white foam on top of the hazy, dark copper colored body. The head settles slowly and leaves decent lace on the glass. S - Musty pine grapefruit and some bready toffee in the background. T - Bready malt up front with some toffee and pithy grapefruit. Pine shows up in the middle but fades away as the finish comes on. Moderately strong bitterness and a lingering grassy flavor. M - A moderately thick body, slightly higher than average carbonation, and a Lilly sweet finish. D - Well, the malt base is well put together but the hop character is a bit lacking with bitterness as the most substantial component. don't know how fresh this really was but I suspect that it may have once had. Better hop aroma than it does now. "

I also pick up some molasses mixed with caramel sweetness too. Slightly hazy orange in color with a light tan colored head. Lacing is lacking a bit. The Immortal brings tangerine on the palate, it actually feels like you're biting into and eating a slightly underripe tangerine. Even the burst of citrus is present that you get when you break those cells in the fruit. Very tasty, however, thats all I get, and I tend to like a bit more to my beer, even IPAs. Moderate carbonation with a body that evenly matches it. It's good, but not great. "

Color is a clear amber with loads of bubble trails. Aroma is malt, hop, grapefruit, a little resin. Flavor's like nose, but really, really nice - fairly dry up front, a little carbonation works well with the bitter and the hint of sweet follows up for good balance. Body is excellent, full, chewy and in perfect coordination with flavor. Finish is like flavor, of average length, a hint boozy, and eminently drinkable. Got to get back out to Seattle. Well done guys! "
681,2018,dbrauneis,7/11/12," A: Pours a crystal clear golden orange in color with light amounts of visible carbonation. The beer has a finger tall light beige head that reduces to an extremely thin film covering the majority of the surface of the beer with a small thicker patch and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate to significant amounts of lacing are observed. S: Light to moderate aromas of citrus/grapefruit and tropical/pineapple hop aromas. T: The beer starts out with a toasted and caramel malt body with lighter flavors of the hops - both citrus/grapefruit and tropical/pineapple + mango. There is minimal amounts of bitterness in this beer and it tastes pretty well balanced. M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Crisp and smooth. O: The hops are not as pronounced as other American IPAs (tastes more like an English IPA) but that makes this beer very easy to drink. A little too high in ABV to be sessionable but from a taste/mouthfeel perspective this one is really easy to put down. "

Creamy biscuit malts with a little lagery yeast type smell on the finish. T: Grassy and semi-piney hops are up front. There is a little bittering action to it. There is a white bread malt body to this that is pretty hefty, some oats too. The finish has some sweet fruits and a little yeasty component. M: Medium bodied with nice lively carbonation.

Toasty, biscuity malt up front in the flavour, rounded by spicy, leafy, citrus hops that dry out on the finish with some mild alcohol warmth as well. Grapefruit pith lingers on in a mildly astringent aftertaste. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, light slippery texture with some brisk carbonation, which makes the whole package very quenching and accessible.

The one finger white head has middling retention and and a nice frothy texture. S: This seems like it falls on the citric side of the IPA chart, with pleasant notes of grapefruit and pineapple backed up by some caramel malt. Textbook but well done. T: As I anticipated, this focuses on citrus-forward hop character with caramel notes appearing midpalate. The finish/aftertaste is well balanced with only slight bitterness. Nothing complex or out of the ordinary here, just a solid IPA. There's enough citrus flavor to make this one quite enjoyable. M: Not a palate wrecker by any means, the flavor (save a slight taste of caramel and even slighter lingering resin note) leaves the palate as quickly as it enters it. Medium texture and carbonation. O: There isn't anything here that makes it stand out from its peers, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with it either, making it easy to drink and worthy of future purchase. This would be better on tap. "

Flavor again highlights the floral notes with a backdrop of bready malts from I assume the English influence. Flat on the palate due to the cask, smooth, pretty slick and resinous.

The smell is of citrus hops, orange and lemon and sweet malts. The taste begins with sweet malts, then quickly moves to lemon, lime, then orange then back to lemon/lemongrass. Then finishes with a gritty earthy taste with hop oils lingering on the tongue. The mouthfeel is crisp, clean and gritty. There is a grassy gritty feel when the brew is sloshed around in the mouth. Overall this is a well balanced American IPA. Refreshing and feels as though it would be especially good for a warm summer night. "
714,2018,Buggies,5/14/12," Very muted nose. Slight aromas of citrus. Other than that, very little hop aromas at all. Tastes OK. Slightly sweet up front with citrus and grapefruit. Nice little bitter finish as an IPA should. This beer was just really unremarkable for me. But then again, this might just be a really good example of the style. After drinking beers that push the limits of the style, maybe this one really IS just a good example of what the style should be. As a homebrewer if I brewed this, I would be extremely proud of it. But it just lacks that ""wow"" factor that so many IPAs have these days. Just my 2 cents... "

Smell is bright citrus, like vapors from lemon and orange zest. Slight hint of biscuity sweetness also. Taste is almost juicy. Definitely got the bright orange and lemon zest going on. But, there's also some grassy notes, onion, a hint of mango, and some smooth biscuity malt notes. Mouthfeel is pretty fluffy. Yep NEIPA. Overall, I think the hints of onion took it away from what I would describe as ""juicy."" Still a very good turbid IPA. "

723,2018,jtierney89,5/7/12," On tap at the Spot in Pt pleasant. Pours a lightly hazed (possibly from the chill due to this bar serving everything as cold as he rockies) golden hue. Sticky white head. This is far too cold. Gonna have to give this pint a bit to warm up. This isn't a great bar to go to for craft beer drinking wise, the selections decent but the serving temps, glassware, and staff knowledge is always terrible. Not really seeing the hype on this one. It's nothing special but it is a finely brewed ipa. Sticky sweet grapefruit and caramel upfront rides into big citric hop flavors and slightly bitter and spicy finish. Nothing crazy. Big creamy body and very good lacing. Again nothing special but pretty good. Standard. If anything sets this ipa apart its the subtelty. Flavors aren't in your face. They're just drinkable. "

S: Caramel malts, bready sweet, pair nicely with citrus hops. Neither side gets the upper hand, another pale ale that doesn't deliver its top aroma. T: Mild hops, citrusy, with plenty of caramel. Another IPA that is too balanced. The hops register but they don't linger, a grassy bitterness that isn't too strong. Alcohol also isn't much of an issue, perhaps a silver lining. M: An average mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation but the IPA bitterness is reluctant to come out. At the very least, I brough some Idiot Sauvin home to salvage my trip. "

728,2018,harrymel,5/2/12," ABV 6.3%, Bottled Unk Murky light amber with a finger of persistent creamy foam. Nice piny, grassy hop nose with hints of grapefruit and biscuit malts. Hints of dryness. Medium malts are sweet and, again, biscuity. Hints of bitterness and plenty of fruity, grassy hops - almost a hint of lime. Medium bodied with light carb and some wet finish. A nice beer, and a different take on an IPA for the region IMO. A little sweet, but tastefully so. "

This beer in particular, was crazy drinkable. I had it on tap at Mad Mex Robinson, during happy hora. Pours a bright glowing orange with a shady of haze settling in, fine white head doesn't form very thick but it's there. Aromatics offer up citric glazed hops, candied malts play a nice interplay with a dry yeast component and light biscuit pale malt breadiness. Flavors complement each other nicely, on it's own I got upfront citrus, pine, herbal hop qualities that were balanced nicely with bread dough in a sour dough light and fluffy aspect with some dry powdered yeast cake notes in there. Very bright pleasing on the palate, complemented their southwest wings nicely, cilantro lime jalapeno mixed well with the spicy citric hops. Mouthfeel has the welcoming oily slick mouthfeel found in American IPAs, with moderate smooth flowijng levels of carbonation. Quite honestly this could be a go to IPA, especially with happy hour pricing, but even their bottles are reasonable...Dragontooth a mere 7 bucks for a bomber. "

Aromatic floral, herbal, piney and earthy hops steal the show in the nose. In the taste, herbal, tea like hops with some citrus and earthy tones. Pale, biscuity malt backing, mild caramel notes. Well balanced, though more on the bitter side. Medium bodied, crisp feel with a hop bite. Overall, a good product and always a welcome option on tap. "
764,2018,BeerCentralWA,2/26/12," Great looking IPA, not as fresh and hop forward as I prefer. Very malt driven and well balanced. The hops shine toward the end. Far too sweet for my taste.

771,2018,DCon,1/29/12," Bought a 1 PINT, 6 FL OZ bottle of this from Broulin's in Driggs, ID for $5.99. Poured from the Black Labeled bottle w/ Zeus (or the Lightning Thief"!"!) grabbing a lightning bolt into my 0,47l New Belgium Oversized Snifter Glass. Not sure this means anything but has 110822071 right below the Net Contents & ""ALCOHOL 6.3% BY VOLUME"". Aroma- A prominent citrus and light grapefruit aroma starts this one out. Huge sweetness (due to malt I'm guessing) and has a nice IPA profile. Appearance- Pours a 1.5 finger head that stays for a good amount of time. Has a dark copper/light orange colored body that is clear. Leaves tons of suds behind. Flavor- Has good malts upfront with a medium amount of hop. Sweet once again and mostly fruity. Light bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel- Medium Bodied (barely), Medium Carbonation, Smooth, and a citrus finish concludes this one. Overall Impression- Was never very enthused about this IPA at any part of the drink. Very average and wish there was more body and depth with the hops. Also could have used more flavor. Not sure if it was fresh or not but will give this one another try when the time comes. "
772,2018,hopfacebrew,1/28/12," Note: This review was a re-post from my former account, jmkratt, which was hacked and I lost all my reviews...sorry for the redundancy. Pours a brilliant orange with noticeable opacity and a soft decent head. Aromas are citrusy and sweet though not as prevalent as I would prefer for an IPA. The flavor starts out citrus and mellows nicely to a light malty sweetness. Finishes sweet and light. Mouthfeel is a bit weak and I would like a little more. The beer is pretty middle of the road for an IPA to me. Not terrible but it doesn't really stand out. It's tasty but I find myself wanting more in terms of flavor and aroma.

Not bad but I was expecting some more hops bite in this beer. "

Aroma of apricot, orange, grapefruit and some pineapple, soapy, a bit floral and grassy, a hint of pine, some bready malt as well. Good strength. Flavor is apricot, citrusy orange, lemon and grapefruit, some pineapple, resinous hops, caramel and bready malt make up the middle offering some sweetness to balance against the moderate bitterness on the finish. Minimal alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily, good carbonation. A solid IPA but it may be a bit dated, wish I knew for sure. If it’s fresh, it’s a bit of a let-down, if 8 months old, it has held up rather well. Regardless, it is an enjoyable brew and one I’m glad to have had the chance to try. "

793,2018,cmq103,11/19/11," Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a Duvel Belgian Tulip glass. Appearance: A moderate pour resulted in a 3/4 off white head that diminished to a 1/2 head, which was clinging tightly to the sides of my glass like a fine IPA should. Lighter golden cloudy color, almost Witbier in appearance. Lacing is spot-on and impressive. Smell: Mild pine, citrus hops and malt. I expected a little more on the nose for an IPA. Taste: Just the right amount of sweet citrus hop bite in the beginning, followed by pineapple and grapefruit. The pine bitterness sneaks in at the end and makes sure it’s resilient on the tongue between sips. Malt makes a brief appearance. Mouthfeel: Light to moderate body for an IPA hovering around the 6.2% ABV area. Carbonation is also exactly where it should be for the style. Overall: A smooth and easy drinking IPA with decent flavor, though it didn’t give me that "wow" factor. I could see having a few of these in one sitting when I’m in the mood for an IPA. If I was out at a bar I would order this if it was on tap. I’m glad I tried it but I don’t see myself buying another bottle though. "

806,2018,Chaney,10/27/11," First of all, this one is classified here on BA as an ""American IPA"" but the marketing speak indicated that is is an English one. Oh well.... whatever. A: Poured a clear, gold color, without much redness to add dimension. The head 1/4 finger or so head was both silky and sticky. S: Lots of yeast on the nose and it kind of reminded of Victory's hop profile. However, it had just enough citrus character to remind me that I was drinking an IPA. T: Very unusual. It had the bitterness of a grapefruit, but not the sugar makeup. The yeast was plentiful, and with quite a bit of pepper added for spice. M: Like I said, fairly bitter on the front, middle, and back end, but not much sugar added... I could have used a bit more actually, but that's a minor quibble. The lacing is quite possibly the most foam saturated one I've ever seen. O: Tasty beer. I'm going to review this as an English IPA, because that is honestly what it tastes like to me. If you think I'm wrong, feel free to send me a message on BA. "
807,2018,steelerguy,10/13/11," A - Light amber color with moderate carbonation and a white head. The head sticks around for a bit before becoming lacing on top. S - Lightly toasted malt, a bit bit of hay, very subtle hops notes. T - Malt comes first, some lightly toasted flavors, a bit bread like. The hops are subtle in flavor like the aroma, with a touch of citrus, and a bit of bitterness at the end. M - Moderate body, a little more than most AIPA but it doesn't feel heavy with the carbonation and a bit of alcohol warmth at the end. O - A good IPA, seems more English than American and is certainly more malt forward than most American IPAs. Maybe a good introductory IPA but a bit boring to me. "
808,2018,kingcrowing,10/11/11," On tap poured into a sample glass. Pours a light orange color with a small white head that leaves a thin layer of lacing.

Wow, after having the same beer on cask, this is really fresh and Brite, a nice crisp lemon/cirus with a sharp and bitter finish - Mouthfeel is full and smooth, overall very nice! "
809,2018,CHickman,10/9/11," Pours a slightly hazy light orange color with a creamy 1 finger tan head that fades slowly, leaves a creamy layer on top and very good foamy lacing with rings as it goes down. Smells of sweet malt, caramel, light citrus hops, biscuit and light grains; I really had to inhale deeply to get that much out of this weak aroma, which is odd for an IPA. The smell was almost non-existent, which for an American IPA is bizarre and even for an English IPA would be strange. A big let down in the aroma department. Tastes of sweet malt, caramel, piney hops, light citrus hops, a hint of bitter grapefruit, lemon zest, grains, faint pepper and herbs like tea leaf; a pretty dull IPA that was not well balanced and lacked any real hop kick. This beer is grainy and had more herb than hop flavor, with a metallic almost funky taste in the dry finish. This could be a decent pale ale, but this is not what a West Coast IPA should be and to me is mis-classified. Mouthfeel is light and creamy with a medium body, very light carbonation and a light slightly bitter finish that was almost chalky. Moderately drinkable, this was a decent bland beer and not the IPA I hoped it would be when I bought this bomber. Overall it was major let-down, and while it may be a decent beer I don’t think I’d seek it out again. "
810,2018,Rschis16,10/2/11," Silky white head on top and great retention. Nice lacing from the slowly dissapating. Slight haze in the orange beer with dark yellow highlights. Lots of visible carbonation. The smell is very pleasant, lots of citrus and a small biscuity backing. Not extremely aromatic, but nice. Big piney bitter taste up front, very flavorful. Has to be pretty high in the IBU category as the hops come on very assertively at first. They give way to a small, but balancing biscuit malt, followed by a hit of citrus and bitterness in the back. The hops definitely do a little dance on the palate, very lively in taste and feel. The balance, as stated on the label, is really well done in that the hops never fully overtake the palate, but they do come close at times. Medium to high carbonation that leads to a crisp, clean finish, but an almost creamy mouthfeel. The bitterness lingers on after the taste, enticing you to take another sip. This is my first beer from Elysian and I'm glad I picked this up. Very well done, I will be buying others. "

Black label with a poorly defined illustration of a hand.. holding a ray of energy" Side offers a braggy description of the brew and brewery. Offers a badly printed bottling code, and shows 6.3% Alc. by Vol. Served in a tulip glass. A - Pale to medium amber pour with a good frothy head, fair retention and surface memory, with some lacing. S - Soft bitterness in the nose with a citric and caramel touch. T - Taste offers a soft hoppy range generically bitter with faint touches of grapefruit and grass, malty caramel in the backbone with a return to some astringent bitterness. M - Medium to medium-light body with moderate carbonation. O - Hmmm, fair flow but very short of remarkable. Notes: Part of the flow of new distribution in the region coinciding with the local beer week. This was supposed to be one of the highlights and it is quite forgettable "English IPA" In that it is subdued and not to stimulating" An English IPA should and can do better than this.. "
816,2018,Huhzubendah,9/24/11," Bottle shared by afdempse. Thanks Adam. The beer is yellowish orange, with a half inch of head, appearing fairly hazy. The aroma is really weak. One shouldn't have to bury their nose in the glass, searching for hop scents. Additionally, I discovered an odd scent that was not particularly inviting. The taste was equally disappointing, with a general lack of hop presence. The weird scent translated to the flavor profile as well. The feel was not up to par, with more butter than bitter. Overall, mediocre at best. Not a repeat for me. "
817,2018,afdempse,9/15/11," 22oz. bottle Hazy orange-blond with a thin head. Very light aroma - hard to detect what's going on here Extremely muted hop flavor, dull maltiness. Hard to call this an IPA, with so little going on in the flavor department. Did I get an old bottle" Date looks like it was bottled in July of this year, but the dating system is rather cryptic. I agree with EspressoGuy, How about a bottled-on date" Even still, the hops that I do taste seem fresh enough, there's just not enough of them. Bitterness levels are low. Hmm.. Mediocre at best. Would consider trying on tap if I knew it were fresh. Buyer beware. "
818,2018,jayhawk73,9/14/11," Pours a light gold/copper color w/ a really nice two finger off white head. Excellent carbonation and lacing on this brew. Fairly easy to see through, but not crystal clear. Head sticks around for a while. Fantastic appearance. Smell is not as hoppy as I'd expected. There's a good share of citrus fruit and malt in the nose. Some peach as well- it's actually a fairly smooth smelling brew. Ok- there are the hops on the taste. Not super bitter, but they are present. The whole taste profile is put together really well. All the flavors just melt into each other. Taste is very similar to the nose except for the hops. Very well balanced, and easily drinkable. Feel is medium w/ a fairly dry finish. The malt is in there as well though- just really nice. Overall this is a really nice IPA, and I recommend it. Really glad I got to try this beer. Cheers! "
819,2018,BerkeleyBeerMan,9/12/11," Appearance: Light honey amber color. Mix of golds and yellows. Very beautiful. This beer glows in the glass. The head pours a foamy off-white 1/2 inch. Big bubbles make themselves known. Smell: Cereal grains. Biscuit. Spices. Squash and pumpkin are also present. Hints of vanilla bean and cookie and even slight banana esters. Lightly roasted malts. The hops are mildly floral and spicy. English tea flavors emerge. Taste: The taste is sweet overall. The hops provide balance. The malts are the dominant force in this beer. I taste tea, sugar and sweet cookie pastries. A taste reminiscent of a ginger cookie. The vegetal hops are lightly interspersed with floral flavors. Overall, the taste is very delicate. Mouthfeel: Very light for on the tongue for IPA (no cloying bitterness, but the body is full. The malts are present. The hops and malts blend nicely. The finish is clean and slightly dry. Overall: A very unique IPA. It has many qualities of an english IPA but it is also wise in the craft of american brewing. The ingredients are terrific. You can tell this blend took effort and forethought. Immortal IPA is very smooth, enjoyable and drinkable. P.S. You can't beat an ABV this low when the beer is this good "
820,2018,EspressoGuy,9/2/11," 22 oz. Tough to read the dating but I suspect this may not be a fresh bottle even though it was purchased from a cold room. I wish more breweries would adopt what many specialty coffee roasters are now doing: clear, easy to understand, roasted on dates instead of best before dating. Choosing the freshest beer possible creates a much better experience and Best Before dating is completely arbitrary. A- rich golden honey. Nice head. S- negligible but not flawed. Tried in two different glasses and still detected very little. This is why I suspect an aged bottle. T- nicely balanced with a pleasant lingering, long lasting bitterness that doesn't overpower. Not much complexity though. M- Nice fine bubbles creating a rich mouthfeel. O- Nice but not memorable. Based on its reputation, I would like to try this on tap or seek out a fresher bottle. "
821,2018,Yagman3000,8/26/11," Served from a 22 oz. bomber into a Chimay silver-rimmed goblet. Appears a medium to dark yellow with a hint of rose coming through at its core. A very small film remains on top from a short head that initially sat. There's a ridge of bubbles to one side that are screaming creaminess. Its smell does not really reveal a hop-profile which disturbs me a bit in an IPA. I get a little bit of malt breadiness here but no real bitterness or fruit. Taste has a mild bitterness, again no fruit, and some malt characteristics too. Again, I look for the hops in an IPA and I'm just not getting it here. It's pleasant, but for the genre""" Its mouthfeel is a little on the fizzy and effervescent. "
822,2018,drabmuh,8/22/11," This was my favorite IPA from Elysian so far. Beer is yellow / amber, mostly clear, thin white head of small bubbles, some lacing, looks good. Aroma is earthy, piny, and mildly citrus, nice. Beer is medium in body and sweet on the front with a mild to moderate hop profile and a good finish on the backend. It doesn't finish too dry but with just a hint of dryness to get through the bitterness and bring it forward. I enjoyed it and would have it again. "
823,2018,Spica66,7/28/11," Got this as an extra from jerriko. Thanks, Evan! A: Hazy, light gold pour with good head formation and retention. Some lacing. S: Definite citrus hop nose. Amarillo, maybe" There is a decent malt background as well. T: Maltier than the nose suggests. The bittering is definitely Centennial. The Amarillo must have been for aroma only. Pretty well balanced. M: Very smooth and round. Well done. O: Very decent beer. "
824,2018,LazyL,2/16/11," Light hazy orange with 2 fingers of pillowy white head. Good retention on the glass. Not allot of hops on the nose. I get more sweet malty scents. A fair bit of yeast bread as well. Nice citrusy flavours with a medium bitterness. A little bit of pine too. Medium carbonation with a dry finish. Seems a bit mortal to me. "
825,2018,spinrsx,7/18/11," 0% Bomber Appearance: Slightly hazy copper colour with a large size frothy beige coloured head. There is a low amount of carbonation showing and there is a really good amount of lacing. The head lasted for around 6 minutes before it was gone. Smell - Malts, hops, caramel, chocolate" Taste & Mouth - The beer has an above average amount of carbonation and I can taste malts, caramel, and hops. I can also taste the alcohol a bit, and there are some tropical fruit notes.. pineapples. It finishes with a malty sweet aftertaste with a light amount of lingering hop bitterness. Overall: While this beer is pretty good and highly drinkable, I prefer my IPA's to have more of a citrus profile. This beer seemed to be more focused on the tropical fruit side of things. It would be a decent session IPA, as the flavours aren't to over the top. I'm happy I gave it a try, but would reach for something else next time. "
826,2018,hreb,7/16/11," Cold 22oz bottle served in pint glass. Beer is a pale straw golden with a respectable white head. Cascadey hop aroma and the first sip confirms this is a classic West coast American IPA. Secondary flavors of citrus (standard IPA profile of grapefruit and lemon zest). Really thin on the malt backbone. This is one dry attack of hops. Not too intense to be either drinkable or refreshing, though. A high quality, reliable IPA, if not the most complex or interesting. "
827,2018,distantmantra,7/15/11," On cask at Elysian Fields. Seattle, WA. July 14th, 2011. Bailed on the Mariners game and found this on cask at Elysian's location near the stadiums. A: Golden in color, slightly cloudy. Good one-finger head of creamy foam with average lacing. S: Flowery hop aroma with a hint of pine, citrus and wine. T: Very hoppy with some citrus and wine flavors from the cask. Hint of nuttiness is present, but very minimal. M: Very mellow mouth feel with low carbonation. O: Not a bad IPA, but the low carbonation kind of killed it for me. Need to try the non-cask version again to compare it. "
828,2018,notchucknorris,7/14/11," A: Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a huge 2 finger cream colored head. S: The hops are there, but a little faded. Sweet fruity malts and some citrus hops. A little mango and some cantaloupe as well. T: Really malty with some citrus hops trying to squeak through in the background. Some faint tropical fruit as well. Not as hoppy as I'm used to but the slightly creamy mouthfeel makes this really drinkable. "
829,2018,Franch,6/16/11," pretty unremarkable ""IPA"", which tasted a bit more like an American Pale Ale than an IPA. it seems to me that this is a beer that would have been very highly regarded in the nascent days of american IPAs, but the hops and time have passed it by, and it's still sitting there. "
830,2018,Supersweetshirts,5/6/11," I had passed by this beer numerous times at the beer store and it had always caught my eye. After reading some mediocre reviews that delayed previous impulse purchase attempts, today I caved in and decided to give it a try. The beer poured a nice hazy, golden amber and had a really impressive thick, clingy, eggshell colored head on it that remained constant for most of the beer. This wasn't as hoppy as I normally prefer my I.P.A.'s but it was rich in honey citrus flavors without being too sweet. What impressed me the most was the incredible balance of flavor. It wasn't too sweet but it had just the perfect blend of pine, grapefruit, and sweet fruits. "
831,2018,jwhancher,4/14/11," Bought a 22 from the SPTR's bottle shop last weekend. Never had this before, so it seemed like it was worth a try. A: pours a mostly clear gold with slight amberish tint. At the bottom oif the bottle is some yeast & hop matter. Nice frothy white head that clings to the glass. Light carbonation. S: a very light hop aroma. Mostly citrus & pine hops. A sweet, almost honey like, malt aroma also takes presence. T: just like the aroma, but with a light crystal malt which gives a liitle caramel flavor. Not really hop forward for an IPA. M: nice & light. Not really bitter, a little sweet actually. Again I get a slight honey flavor which adds some sweetness. Carbonation is low. O: a nice beginner IPA for the novice craft drinker or non-hophead. By today's standards, there's more hop forward APA's than this. Still, not a bad beer by any means. "
832,2018,thebrood1987,4/10/11," It has a darker yellow color with little suspended particles in it. It smells different than your average IPA with a sweet floral somewhat fruity smell. The taste is where this beer really shines in my opinion. You get a nice hop bite with that sweet bready malt and then ending with a citrus inside of an orange peel TART dry bitterness. Nice bitterness to this beer that isn't too overwhelming. I like that the bready malts are rich and give the body a somewhat chewy feel to it which is nice since its a lighter colored beer. You can also get some pine from the hops as well. This is an extremely easy drinking IPA and it almost drinks like a double IPA. This kind of reminds me of a lower alcohol content version of Double Trouble by Founders. Hop heads will definitely not be disappointed by this one. The bitterness grows as you drink it and it can get pretty tart but the bready malts keep everything in check and wash the bitterness away just a little so it isn't out of balance. If you want good balance and REAL easy drinkability but still have those hop alpha acids then look no further. "
833,2018,meeekyh,3/28/11," I was feeling like an IPA tonight and was surprised to see this on the shelf at a local LQ that has been having problems with their stock. I then discovered this beer is now brewed in Fort Collins and Seattle and now I get it. I will be using a belled beer-glass and am pouring from a 22oz bottle. The color is a middle gold and the head is off-white with good lacing but not much loft or staying power. The nose is very full of grain and light citrus, nothing overwhelming and it makes me look forward to the balance. Taste is somewhat sweet and tart with a bit of bitterness but overall a nice balance and flavor. Mouthfeel is meduim bodied with middling carbonation and a slightly dry finish that lingers a bit with grainy sweetness. I like this beer. It is a good IPA without being over hopped or sweet from too much malt. I appreciate the lack of toasted and caramel flavors and the way the hops play together and with the malts. This is well balanced and highly drinkable. Salinte. "
834,2018,Rutager,2/28/11," Appearance. Deep gold with a touch of red. Nice sticky yellow finger and a half slowly leaving some beautiful, dense lacing. Smell. Toasty light grain and malt and some citrusy hops. Taste. Strong light malt presence with a bitter, grassy finish and a little white grapefruit rind. Not bad. Mouthfeel. Good prickly carbonation. A little alcohol presence. Drinkability. A decent drinker with a clean finish. "
835,142974,coltonbrimhall,5/27/15," -lighter brown orange foam with red hue beer - smell is bourbon with some hop scent - taste like the normal one but with the sweet bourbon feel - slightly syrup feel - overall not a big bourbon fan so thats prob for my feel "
836,2018,Haybeerman,2/7/11," A: Orange/amber color; slight haze. Poured a 2 finger rocky white head that dissipated to a thick film. Decanted lazily. Sticky lace intermittently on the glass. S: Very citrussy with some floral character. Malt in the background is bready and sweet becoming more pronounced as the beer warmed. T: Sweet, pale malt and citrus rind. A little resiny floral character in the middle. Floral character holds to a building bitter. Not quite what I expected form a West Coast IPA. M: Medium body. Moderate to ample carbonation. Slightly resiny then dry in the finish D: Easily drinkable. Not a big IPA. "
837,2018,Hollybee,1/30/11," Pours golden yellow with a very thick, pillowy head. Smell is floral and hoppy with strong orange peel Taste is sweet and light with a strong orange flavor. Hops bitter middle and finishes rather cleanly with a bit of the bitter remaining in the back of the mouth. Light in body with good carbonation. very drinkable. It's possible that I've been over-hopped drinking lots of west coast IPAs, but I did expect a stronger hop flavor profile and smell, very good however. "
838,2018,Ego,1/26/11," eyes... one full finger of rather white head, mildly soapy, dark straw color, much lighter hue than most IPAs that cross this desk, good sticky lacing as this slowly retreats down the glass, carbonation is active and the head is hanging out for some time now. nose... caramel malt with herbal type hops, very balanced and yet unexciting, nothing off kilter here just not too much to report taste etc... decent hop bite, balanced, the carbonation is active, easy drinking, the body is light to medium, kind of non descript, not bad in any way but not catching my attention in any way. verdict" slightly better than average "
839,2018,Mebuzzard,1/17/11," Had this on tap earlier...found a bottle, so I drank it. Pours a very slightly hazed amber-orange. Head is quite nice, fluffy white, some rockiness and nice lacing. A mix of hops goings-on in the nose. Mostly subdued citrus with some pine/woodiness. Lightly charred malt. Tastes peerrrtty good. It's not an extreme IPA by any stretch, but it holds its own. Hops dominate, not overly so, with the malt supplying a solid yet unobtrusive biscuity backbone. Sharp dryness without the puckering finish. Very easy drinking. If you want a hop-bomb, this ain't it...but if you want a nice IPA, give this one a try "
840,2018,Beaver13,1/7/11," 22oz bottle, best by 12/5/10 (but received for Christmas). Pours a hazy yellow gold with a small bubbly white head that quickly diminishes to a thin film that leaves some lacing. The aroma is sweet bready malts, grains and a little melon and a touch of sulfur. The flavor is some sweet grainy malts and sugary melon with a medium tarry bitter finish. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and watery. Overall, this may have suffered a little from age, but I've had it fresh too and not been impressed. "
841,2018,ArrogantB,1/1/11," 22oz bottle $3.49, not too shabby of a price. Orange color and a smell that was a little bit odd, couldn't place it. The flavor was very malty, easily an English style IPA which is a cool change of pace from the hop bombs I usually love so much. I bet this would be really good on cask. "
842,2018,TheFightfan1,12/31/10," crystal clear golden color with the thickest white heading I have ever seen on an IPA. Fantastic lacing. Your traditional IPA. Heavy bitter hops with an ever so sweet malty backbone that tastes like a cracker. Hops tingle on the palate with it's light body and finishes very crisp and clean. A great looking IPA but the taste is just like many. "

848,2018,flexabull,12/17/10," 0% Pours a bright orange color, slight haze, and a decent white head. Aromas are of hard candies, grapefruits, and tangerines. Kind of faint though. Tastes starts out with bitter lemon zest then settles into light tea, and caramel malt sweetness. All in all the flavors are mellow, but nice. Mouthfeel is ok, but on the thin side. Drinkability is good. This came off to me as being a more mellow IPA, but it's flavorful enough, and pretty easy to drink. "
849,2018,flagmantho,11/21/10," Poured from 22oz bomber into a pint glass. My bottle says 6.3% ABV rather than the 6.21% listed above. Appearance: pours a pale golden hue with a touch of haze, a few tiny floaties and two fingers of frothy ivory head. It's extremely middle-of-the-road. Smell: aroma consists of some slightly citrusy, slightly funky hops, but the volume is way too low. Some styles demand subtlety, but the West Coast IPA is not one of those styles. Well-composed, but weak. Taste: an interesting flavor, and I'm sad to say I don't love it. The hops in the aroma really fall apart in the flavor, and what I'm left with is a malty, soapy mess. A little bit of citrus is all the hops give you, plus a bit of bitterness at the end but not enough to let you know you're drinking an IPA. Plus, as I mentioned, there is a bit of a soapy quality which, while not actually terrible, doesn't do this beer any favors. All of that said, it's not a bad beer per se; it's just not a very good example of an IPA. Mouthfeel: finally, an area in which this beer excels. Body is medium to medium-light, but the carbonation is very good and texture is nice and creamy. Dig it! Drinkability: I'm a little torn on this beer. I feel it doesn't do a great job as an IPA and it definitely has some flavor issues (re: soap). Still, it manages to be a pretty quaffable brew. What to do" Call it average-to-good. "
850,2018,taigor,11/4/10," Poured into regular pint glass. A - Poured clear yellow color with small head that quickly dissipated leaving average lacing around the glass. S - Very hoppy with a strong citrus scent. T - Slightly fruity to start with strong hops present all the way to finish. M - Medium bodied with average carbonation. D - Very enjoyable IPA and I would recommend it. "
851,2018,Mora2000,11/3/10," Thanks to 5000 for sending this bottle my way. The beer pours a yellow-orange color with a white head. The aroma has perfume and floral notes, along with some biscuit malt. The flavor is flowers, pine and earthy hops with some biscuit malt and low bitterness. The beer tastes like it was hopped with a mix of both English and US hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. "
852,2018,beer2day,10/28/10," Nose is surprisingly malty. Get a fleeting one finger head on a hazy yellow gold pour. No retention but thick lace. Very malty nose. Where are the hops" Finally, some weak grapefruit sneaks in with a little tangerine. Strong amber flavor. Thick feel for the style. Way more malt than hops. Disappointing. Not even remotely an ipa. "
853,2018,Derek,10/26/10," A: Clear golden yellow with a white head, good retention & lace. S: Grassy, light pine & citrus rind, light vanilla. Nice, but not a huge nose for an IPA. T: Tangerine and grapefruit rind, slightly grassy, a little peach & vanilla, solid bitterness, hints of grainy biscuit. The hopping is more PNW pale than IPA, but it's good. M: Well-attenuated with a crisp finish. Some people might say you need more of a malt backbone, but would that survive a voyage to India" D: An easy drinker. "
854,2018,CHADMC3,10/4/10," Pours a deep golden body with orange hues and a frothy white head that rests atop the beer for a few minutes before leaving a thin white lacing. Pine and citrus hop aromas waft from the glass, followed by other sweet citrus notes, and fresh grass. The palate offers quite a nice hop punch, pine, grassy, and citrus; followed by a malt backbone, and back to the hops for the finish. Medium in body and carbonation, there is a slight drying aspect to the finish, while still being quite crisp. This is a tasty example of the style, plenty of character to offer the senses, but nothing too dominant. "
855,2018,BARFLYB,9/16/10," On tap at Memphis Taproom in a big ol pint glass, i was in need of a hop fix. A- Immortal kinda looks like it is dying. Str8 off the spout in front of me this thing barely formed a decent sized head, looks bronze i9n appearance like a lager. I trust this taproom so I don't think it's a problem from the line. S- Smells like a fairly hoppy lager with earthy hops and no citrus whatsoever, isn't this from the left coast" Grain out the ass and a malty sweet base. T- Immortal did not remind me of a IPA, I don't know what it resembled, but Im still thinking hopppy lager. No 3C action, just earthy GRASSY hops with a faint sweet malt kick. What is wrong with this beer" M- Not memorable, not bitter even in the slight, a step up from light bodied with a light carb. This one just kinda felt dead to me in IBU's or something. D- I tourtured myself and drank the whole thing. I was trying to get to know this beer and truth be told there is nothing to know, so I chugged the rest of it. Very drinkable with the low abv but very forgetable with the low taste as well. I've been seeing this on the shelves here for a few years and I guess the only thing immortal about this beer is the recipe, which is in dire need of dying and being re tooled. Just a thought. "
856,2018,bradleyp,8/11/10," Pours a lite golden color. Once in the glass, it looks very much like how an IPA should look. Smelled very hoppy and citrusy like a Grapefruit or an Orange. Not very drinkable, but is def. worth trying again. I'm not a huge fan of IPA's but I could learn to be more open-minded when it comes to drinking these beers. "
857,2018,NWer,8/5/10," Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. A - Clear golden amber appearance, minimal bronze head that disipated quickly - what there was. S - Nice pleasant grapefruit essence. T - More grapefruit - Very smooth. Not overwhelmingly hoppy. M - The beer feels very pleasant in the mouth and the aftertaste is very pleasant. D -. Very drinkable. I'm thinking about having another. This is a very easy going, pleasant IPA that works well in the summer. Note: ""Best by 11 28 2010"" printed on bottom right corner of label. Label claims 6.3% ABV not the 6.21 noted in the description. Label has been changed. Needs to be updated. Is there a way to do that" "
858,2018,industrialswill,7/22/10," Looks like murky motor oil in the glass. Smells of hops and malt. Citrus hop and malt flavor, very nice. This one is as good as any IPA, [for the most part]. Being forced to buy it as a 22 oz bottle for $4 will limit my consumption of this one. Worth a try if you are a curious fan of IPAs. "
859,2018,GRPunk,7/11/10," 22oz bottle poured into a nonic pint. A- A moderate pour left a 1 finger head that drops to about 1/2 finger and leaves excellent sticky rings and spots all about the glass. The body was a hazy, golden-orange with moderate carbonation. S- It's fairly hop forward at first with a very organic mix of grassy and grapefruit notes. Sugary sweet malts are in the background. A little warmth opens it up. Malts become a little more grainy. T- It presents a solid hoppy punch at first. It's a nice mix of pine and grapefruit. Sweet and grainy malts hold it together. In the end it's really well balanced for the style. M- Moderate carbonation. It's fairly viscus and coats the mouth, but still smooth. Not too much bite considering the solid hop aroma and flavor. D- Very good as IPAs go. I put back 3 with dinner recently without tiring of it or getting a hop overload. I'd drink it again when it's available. It seemed a bit fresher on-tap. I might bump up the flavor 1/2 point if I was reviewing at the bar (it was poured quite nicely too). I actually thought it was local to NJ (where I was visiting) since I was at the Elysian Cafe which is down the street from Elysian Park. "
860,2018,coastiefish,7/8/10," 22&gt;pint glass 1 finger foamy white head fades to a thin layer with big bubbles. Subtle cereal and floral-perfumy nose with a touch of vanilla. Soapy and minor bit salty taste. The foamy, soapy stays true in the mouthfeel. I would say a bit of tinny metallic. It is an interesting beer for me due taking my time with it, and distinguishing certain features. notes: (awesome) new label this summer, different from the one in the display picture posted. "
861,2018,Briken,6/30/10," Golden copper with big frothy tan head and good lacing. Floral and pine aroma with a buttery sweetness. A little bit of everything... floral and pine with a grapefruit bitter finish. Well balanced with a little caramel sweetness which is the first taste but shifts quickly to the abundant hops. Hops diminish slightly in intensity by the end of a bomber. Sharp with moderate to high carbonation creating a refreshing overall feel. Like I said... a little bit of everything. Hops to please and balanced with malts. Pretty easy drinking and flavorful. "
862,2018,appenzeller,6/23/10," Cloudy light orange with a thick frothy head. This one smells of hops--big surprise!--the taste is a little more nuanced. Fruity, citrusy taste up front with a dry and sharp hops profile following. This also tastes of spice, cinnamon or even cumin" I've always liked this beer, kind of a Seattle regular, although it's ultimately pretty much the standard profile of a ""West Coast IPA."" "
863,2018,Beerandraiderfan,6/22/10," Gold yellow copper mix. Good lace and retention. Aroma comes off English and non dry hopped. Taste, a little less English, but not your prototype West Coast ipa. Caramel and lesser hops. Bitterness is in the appropriate to average range for style and region. Pretty straightforward, nothing remarkable to speak of mouthfeel wise. A decent price, usually $4-5 a bomber. "
864,2018,david18,6/22/10," Got a 22 ounce at my local beer supermarket thinking I had tried already. It was a very decent serviceable ipa but not the best I've had. Light in color. Heavy carbonation. Good but light bitterness with good hop aroma and flavor. Very good ipa. I'll get it again. "
865,2018,honeybrewer,6/5/10," 22 oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a golden color, not quite perfectly clear. Half an inch of creamy white head. Smells of citrus hops and grass, fruit, and malt. Also kind of a sweet smell to it. Fairly well balanced malt to hop taste. Citrus, bready malt, and grassy hops. Overall I think this is a fairly good beer, and I generally don't like IPAs. The balance between the malt and hops makes this a much more drinkable beer than the usual West Coast style IPA, which in my opinion are nothing more than hop juice. Reasonably priced, goes down easy. Very drinkable beer. "

867,2018,lstokes,5/31/10," I'm a sucker for a strong hop nose, especially when it's citrusy like this one--this has a typical American IPA profile, with grapefruit, peach and a touch of pine in the hops and a classic well-balanced caramel backbone. The mouthfeel is also very vibrant. I got a little bit of yeast in the taste as well, and thought the beer ended with a sour yeasty note, but that didn't significantly detract from what is a solid IPA. "
868,2018,Bouleboubier,5/14/10," Orangey gold. Grapefruit and hints of nutty in the aroma. Tartness and grapefruit highlight and dominate the flavor - slightly more tart than grapefruit. Easy drinking - smooth and fruity. Nothing that particularly stands out with this IPA. A decent, textbook example of a citrusy American IPA. I'd accept an offer for one in the future. "
869,2018,MisterClean,4/4/10," Purchased at city beer in SF. A - Pours copper-golden with 3 fingers of white foamy head. Dissipates slow and leaves nice lacing. S/T - Hints of honey and caramel chased by grapefruity and grassy hops. The malts are just complex enough to bring out an almost hard to believe equilibrium between malts and hops. M - Medium to full bodied, slightly hop dominated, and smooth. D - Good overall. Nothing to wowing, but liked the malt complexity. "
870,2018,PDXHops,3/19/10," Bomber poured into a Duvel tulip. Hazy golden orange body with a fluffy white head that settles down into a denser layer with long-lasting clumps. Lacing is pretty good. The citrus in the nose- tangy orange, pineapple- a few drops of grapefruit juice- comes close to being overpowered by plentiful sweet malts. The flavors follow along. Sweet and tasty, but not a lot in the way of bitterness. Goes down easy, but not really memorable. A little too malt-focused for an IPA. "
871,2018,unHipHopHead,3/3/10," A - Pours hazy golden color, nice fluffy head that dissipates about halfway through and leaves a thick sticky lacing behind. S -Bready, caramel malts up front with hops backing... interesting when you are used to SD style IPA's that are all about the hops this one catches you off guard. As someone else mentioned though, this is a take on an English style IPA. T - Sweet, very rich malt, almost caramel with some earthy hops in the middle followed by a mild bitterness. M - A thicker mouthfeel than other American style IPAs. Mild carbonation and a bit tangy. D - This is a good cold weather brew, pretty heavy on the malts and sweetness. Not going to feel like doing much after one of these guys. Overall - A pretty well balanced beer that could be a good alternative to a lager or amber IMO. "
872,2018,ghebel,2/26/10," A - Pours slightly hazy gold to amber color - almost orange. Head is an adequate, off - white, but dissipates quickly with some lacing left on the glass. Lots of bubbles escaping to the top. S -Bready, caramel malts up front with citrusy and earthy hops. More on the malty side that many American IPAs. This makes sense as the bottle states it is an interpretation of a classic English style. T - Sweet, rich malt with a balanced earthy (almost floral) hop profile. Mild to moderate bitterness. M - Moderate body, ""thicker"" than many American IPAs. Carbonation bite with a tangy twinge turning to a lasting bitterness. Mild alcohol sensation in the end. Warming on the throat. D - Drinkable beer. Makes me feel fuller than many IPAs. Maybe the carbonation or maybe the heavier malts. Either way - not one to drinks lots of. Overall - Nicely balanced IPA that is more malty than many American IPAs. Hops are present, but not as in your face. Blended and mellow. "
873,2018,alli4051,2/21/10," Poured from a 750ml bottle into a pint. A: Pours a hazy copper with a half inch of white head that dissipates quickly leaving some nice lacing. S: Strong scent of leafy hops with with some maltiness as well. T: While the leafy hops are definitely front and center there is a strong malt character as well. Not that this makes for an unpleasant taste, I quite like it actually, but I expect less balance and more hops in an american ipa. M: Medium bodied with a dry finish. D: Could easily knock back a few of these. Overall a good beer that is definitely drinkable, will be drinking this one again. "
874,2018,MrDanno96,1/24/10," A: Pours a pretty light golden yellow color with one finger of fluffy white head. Lots of sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. S: Initially I got very little aroma from this, so I let it warm for about 20 minutes... still not a whole lot. Lots of generic grainy notes, which can mostly be attributed to sweet malts. Very little hop aroma at all, which is disappointing for an IPA. T: Is this really an IPA" It just tastes more like a pale ale to me. Lots of grainy malt up front, bread, and biscuits. Some bitter hops in the finish, but nothing that comes close to the hop profile of an IPA. No pine or citrus at all to speak of. It doesn't taste bad really, just doesn't taste like an IPA. M: A medium body with a decent amount of carbonation. D: It's a decent drinking beer I suppose. No great flavors, though, and the lack of hops is disappointing. I notice that the best by date is just a few days from today, maybe some of the hop taste has faded" Even if that is the case, I doubt it could have lost this much flavor if it was really hoppy at some point. "
875,142974,rspauldi,5/26/15,
876,2018,asabreed,2/17/10," Bomber into a pint glass. Thought this would be a DIPA with the name and the label at first, but it looks like it's not going that route, which is certainly fine by me. Appearance: Mildly hazy copper and golden color, with a head that leaves Jackson Pollock-like lacing all over the glass, initially, and with subsequent pours. Nice concentrated and slow bubbles gurgling to the top, and there are some floaties after the first pour. Also, just inspecting the bottle before I poured, it looks like a lot of hops have settled at the bottom, unless there's some yeast, too. I love that, and it continues to make me happy when the murk lies at the bottom, slowly wavering in the bottle with a slight flick of the wrist. Smell: Big inviting candied fruit aromas at first, like candied oranges or pears, along with a bit of leafy hops and caramel syrup. Taste: There's a good sense of candied and caramel malts at first, along with some cherry, pear, and citrus. But it slowly morphs into pleasantly commingling hop bitterness, more rinds than leaves. The slow meld is really interesting and inviting, and it seems to be subtly nuanced as the flavors change like that with each sip. Interesting how I'm not sure I've noticed this in a brew before. Mouthfeel: Not as much carbonation as I'd have liked at first, but it comes through at the end in a nice concentrated burst. Lighter to medium-bodied, and slightly oily I'd say. Drinkability: More of an English IPA, as they set out for. And I'm not sure the style above shouldn't be changed, but alas. A very solid, sessionable, and highly drinkable version of the style. I'll be trying this again and seeing if I can get more from Elysian, as this is my first. "
877,2018,hophead247,2/15/10," Pours amber with a big off white head that stays pretty well and laces the sides of the glass. Nice aroma of grapefruit and pine over caramel malts. Flavor contains lots of hop flavors, grapefruit, pine, some pineapple, and a touch of malt, biscuit and caramel. Pretty well balanced and an easy drinker. The beer is well carbonated but not overly so. Medium body. I enjoyed this one. "
878,2018,Mojoman8561,2/9/10," -L-Clear copper color. Poured with a good head that hung around for a while. -S- The leaf hops really stand out to me.Tucked behind it are some nice fleshy fruit aroma's. -T- Good hops blend. Not over whelming in the least. A little grapefruit and pear mixed in there. -F- Thin. started bigger than it finished as well. The only real draw back I found with this one. -D- Overall maybe the easiest IPA I've ever had. With it's relatively mild ABV I think this is a decent starter IPA for those unsure of the IPA class. "
879,2018,corby112,2/5/10," Pours a clear golden copper color with slight golden orange hues when held to a lift source with lots of visible carbonation bubbling up and a very thick 2.5 finger frothy off white head that slowly fades into a lasting ring. Sporadic chunks of soapy lacing left behind. Very earthy aroma with a lot of piney hop character, pine needle, lyesol, and faint citrus notes. It kind of smells like air freshener. Very bitter and intensely dry medium body with very earthy pine notes that linger throught into an extremely dry tongue coating finisih. The pine presence is so strong that it actually tasted like chemicals and air freshener. The citrus presence from the aroma is nowhere to be found. It actually feels like I walked into a room that was oversprayed with Lyesol. This beer is way too harsh and difficult to drink. I love ultra hoppy beers, IPA/DIPAs but this beer is just not very good. "
880,2018,riored4v,2/4/10," Reviewed 1/21/10 Poured into a pint glass. Thin, 3/4 finger white head that fades fast. Clear, copper colored body. Smell had hints of caramel malts. Some fruity and floral hops as well. Aroma wasn't strong. Taste had a nice maltiness in the back w/ hints of caramel. Very mild bitterness. Pleasant fruity and floral flavors. Very slight resiny finish. Taste was definitely better than the aroma. Mouthfelel was light body with medium carbonation. Drinkability was nice and mellow for an IPA. Low bitterness. "
881,2018,Halcyondays,1/30/10," 22 oz. bomber, best by 1-29-10, guess this is the day, A: Pours a translucent yellow-orange, with a light white head. But a great English pint look, with good lace, an almost cask like feel at home. S: Pineapple, grapefruit, really a hybrid English/American style nose, definite malt component. T: Light bready malt with a lot of bitter melon and cantaloupe rind. Good flavour even if the hop profile isn't exactly my style. M: Nice, smooth and resiny. Medium-bodied, an easy quaffing pint. D: Not bad, certainly more in the English style, take it as a strong bitter with some American influence. "
882,2018,GreenCard,1/29/10," Appearance: pale straw/gold to copper, a bit hazy, big layer of fine-beaded foam that seems to stay forever and then turns rocky, bits of lace Aroma: caramel malt, leafy hops, brown sugar Flavor: biscuity malt backbone with an unripe pear hoppiness and fairly low-key bitterness; finishes semisweet with a smooth hoppy aftertaste Mouthfeel: medium-light body, gentle carbonation, crisp Other comments: Pour with care! Loose sediment in this bottle. You should probably pour it in one go. "
883,2018,bum732,1/27/10," Pours a slightly cloudy yellow, nice big creamy head. Smells of orange rind, bready malt, some caramel. Tastes of caramel and toffee like malt with a nice mild fruity bitterness. Some bisquity maltness and mild herbal hoppiness. Finishes with light dryness and some residual bitterness. A pretty solid IPA, i wish my bottle wasn't so old, i feel like a lot of the hoppiness was faded here. But great malt profile, more of an English IPA to be honest. Would love to try this again if i get the chance. "
884,2018,SanDiegoBeerLove,1/25/10," A - Light Copper/Golden color with 1/2 finger of Off-White head. Lacing is good. S - Practically no aroma cold. Smells of grass, sparkling wine, apples, and minerals. T - It is a little bitter with mixture of oily and watery tastes. This is a very light IPA with very minimal tastes of coffee, caramel, and bitter chocolate. M - Medium carbonation with a nice mouthfeel. D - This beer is a very light drinkable beer I guess. Best by date: 1/29/2010. Drink date: 1/24/2010. Maybe I should have tried it when I bought it, oops. "
885,2018,snaotheus,1/23/10," 22oz bottle poured into a large snifter Pours a cloudy bronze-gold color, slight head but almost all of it sticks to the glass. Visible, fine, slow carbonation. Looks thick and syrupy. Smell is not very strong (maybe I have it too cold), but it smells honey-malty with a spicy hop background. Taste is also not incredibly strong, but pleasant. Surprisingly sweet with a nice dry hoppy finish, not extremely bitter (hopefully I haven't burnt out my hop receptors). Mouthfeel is dense but effervescent, carbonation makes it quite pleasant. Very drinkable -- I wouldn't turn it down. Luckily it's pretty cheap -- I got this at QFC in Bellevue for $3/bottle. "

888,2018,deereless,1/17/10," A: There is plenty of sea froth foam which drops to display lots of lacing along the side of the glass, color is gold with a hint of copper - 4.00, S: The aroma is earthy and herbal with a solid grain build, a sweet bready and biscuity smell, mild on the nose for an IPA from the Pacific Northwest but the label does say ""English style IPA"" on it - 3.50, T: Solid hop bite with lots of pine sap flavors, all the hops are nicely balanced with a significant dosing of sweet malts, like the nose this beer is still on the side of meek for an IPA but tasty nonetheless - 4.00, M: Medium bodied beer - 3.75, D: Overall a very enjoyable IPA but probably closer to an APA, I would drink The Immortal IPA again - 3.75 "
889,2018,RKeyser,1/10/10," Poured from 22 into pint glass. Appearance: Light orange-brown. Some haze. Medium carbonation and a persistand light head. Aroma: Light pine and a little citrus, not that big for an IPA. Hop flavor: Bitter, but without much hop flavor to make it interesting. Some piney-ness, but it seems a bit muted. Malt flavor: Light-medium maltyness. Some toasted and grain husk flavor. A little dusty astringency, but maybe that's from the bitter pine hop flavor. Mouthfeel: Does have good mouthfeel. Heavy enough to let you know it's not a chugger, but not filling. Overall: I must have gotten a bad batch. I know I've had this before, though this is the first time I've had it with the intent to analyze it, and wasn't this disappointed. But this one was not good. It doesn't smell good, like it's oxidized or old. The hop flavors, pretty key for an IPA, are muted and dull. Not worth the $2.99. "
890,2018,TheManiacalOne,12/24/09," Acquired via trade from JoeyBeerBelly so a big ""Thank You"" goes out to him. Poured from a 22oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. A: The beer is a dark gold color, with a short off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass. S: The aroma is of caramelized malts, fruity citrus and grassy hops. T: The taste is very well-balanced with sweet flavors of citrus and caramel, a strong but not over-powering hops bitterness and a hearty but not too heavy malt character. This is one of those beers where all of the flavors rotate in and out and complement each other well. The after-taste is slightly sweet. M: Smooth and crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky. D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a very solid beer that is worth drinking for a long time. "
891,2018,GbVDave,12/17/09," Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Hommel Bier tulip. Thyanks to mentor for this from our recent trade! bottle dated DEC 25 09 A: Pours a clear, straw yellow color with a nice one finger layer of bright white foam on top. Beautiful lace curtains were left strewn on the inside of the glass. S: The nose is a nice mixture of vague sweetness, herbal hops, and lightly toasted malt. Some bits of grass and citrus jump into the fray, too. T: Just as above. Mild sweetness followed by herbal/grassy hops, aspirin, tangerines, and caramel. M: Starts off sweet and slick but quickly gains a nicely dry and bitter edge. Finishes a bit prickly and metallic. D: Very nice. I'd like to try the non-contract brewed version of this. "
892,2018,dudecandle,12/4/09," On cask at Rattle n Hum Cask Anniversary Event, NYC: A: Cloudy golden body with a good 1-finger head with modest retention, and decent lacing. S/T: Very nice floral hops up front. You can definitely tell there are multiple types of hops in here, as there's also some piney and herbal flavors. There's also some very pleasant nutttiness to complement. M/D: Nice and mellow, relatively well-rounded body. The flavors never really pop, but it remains very easy and smooth throughout. I'd gladly accept one again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for another Immortal. "
893,2018,rfgetz,11/27/09," Pours a hazy golden amber color with a full fluffy white head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is of muted west coast floral hops with an earhty, malty background. Taste continues with the muted floral and citrus hops, sweet bready malts at almost the same stregth as the present hops. Medium bodied, fully carbonated, earthy and grainy finish. Not sure of the age on this one due to the muted hop profile. "
894,2018,OZz,11/24/09," This is the best beer that new Belgium brews. ... ... ... But not the best Elysian brews. Check out the mens room ale next time your at a Elysian facility. Anybody know why new belgium brews this and not Elysian" The mens room ale sells out very quick so if it's on tap enjoy while you can. MENS ROOM ALE. "
895,2018,chickencoop,11/20/09," Don't know if I let it sit in the fridge too long or it's what it is intended to taste like, but this seemed too sweet. The balance from malt to hops leaned way on the malt side, that being said, this is still a great beer. Poured amber, little lacing. Smell was a sweet floral, but mostly malts. Taste was sweet, and actually refreshing at 6%+ percent. This was very drinkable, lots of sediment, and ended a sweet smoothy beer. "
896,2018,illidurit,11/16/09," Bomber into pint glass. Pours gold with a bit of amber and a beige head that leaves nice lacing. Aroma is sweet cakey malt with honey and some candied citrusy hops. Flavor is sweet orange, honey, apple bread, and a touch of mint. Too sweet, not hoppy enough. Mouthfeel is a little coarse but other ok. "
897,2018,BDJake,11/9/09," A- golden amber with very good sized head that laces all the way down S- floral hop presence and some citrus notes on top of malt, not very prominent T- hoppy, with more of the malt in the initial taste and the hops really come out in the aftertaste and as it warms up... very well balanced M- medium body with good carbonation, bringing out the flavors D- really smooth for the style, I could drink many of these in a session and be happy I had some chips and garlic salsa waiting for dinner while enjoying this, and it paired very well. Elysian is a very good and overlooked local brewery, and they never fail to disappoint. "
898,2018,velosuds,11/2/09," Poured from a 22oz bomber into a clear pint glass. Best by December 25, 2009. Paid $3.99 at local grocery supermarket. A-Pours a golden amber with a two finger, off-white head with great retention and ample, pasty lacing. Beautiful appearance. S-Floral and citrusy hops, but not pronounced enough, and a malty sweetness. Nice aromas, but more intensity is needed for IPA style. T-A balanced West Coast IPA" Who would've thought" Not the typical in your face West Coast style IPA. Hops are present but don't assault the taste buds, and are more present in the finish than the beginning. A milder IPA, more like the English style. Taste improves as it warms. I like more hops and greater intensity. M-Very smooth and balanced. Good carbonation. D-A decent, but not great IPA. More reminiscent of the English vs. American IPA. A very drinkable IPA since not overly bitter and only a 6.2% ABV. This would be a thirst quencher on a hot summer day. It was a pleasant autumn day in PNW and I was hankering after an IPA I have not tried. Won't have this often since there are many other IPAs available that I like better. "
899,2018,mentor,10/30/09," Contract brewed by NBB. Pours a finger of off white head over a brilliant light copper liquid. Gorgeous. Smells eggs, citrus, bubblegum, spicey sugar. Nice complexity and blending of aromas. Lemon, tangerine, some wintergreen. Tastes strong hop flavor with comparable hop bitter and a nice supporting sweet. Well balanced, fresh, and quite enjoyable. Hop flavor is orange, mild pith, lemon, and a little bit of green onion/garlick. Bitter comes across more as a dry oily than a grassy rough. Esters are mild, but some mango and tamarind (I suppose these could be from the hops). Enjoyable flavors of nice intensity. Great balance between the hop flavor and bitterness. Carbonated just a touch more sharply than my preference. "
900,2018,portia99,10/30/09," Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Harpoon IPA tumbler. Bottled 6/19/09...so about 4 months old. A - Pours a pale golden color with a fluffy one finger of white foam on top. Very chunky beer - lots of yeast particles suspended throughout. Head lingers for a good long time and reduces to a thick collar with a lingering layer of bubbles. The suspended particals detract some, but overall a good looking beer. S - Citrusy, fruity, and grassy hops up front over a solid malt backbone. Good bready, yeasty, and sweet malt aromas. Very well balanced IPA. T - Very well balanced flavor follows the aroma. Good crisp and strong bitterness with some fruity and grassy hop flavors. Well rounded sweet and bready malt flavors balance things really well. Very solid. M - Light to medium bodied with ample carbonation. Carbonation is sharp and prickly on the tongue and carries the bitterness along. D - This is a very nice, sessionable IPA. 6.3% makes this not too strong. Well rounded, balanced flavors make this one very easy drinking. A good one to drink with a pizza or burger. Enough flavor to satisfy, but not too overpowering to have a few. "
901,2018,ppoitras,10/29/09," 22oz bottle purchased as a single from Oliver's in Albany, NY. Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" white head over the slightly cloudy golden brew. Head falls slowly, with lace coating and lasting. Aroma is sweet and citrusy. Taste starts sweet, goes lemony in the middle, and closes with a crisp hop bite. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is excellent, especially for a west coast IPA. Great stuff. "
902,2018,bcm119,10/23/09," Clear golden color with a nice lumpy white head. Grain and grassy hops in the aroma. Herbal, minty hops and some husky grain flavors. Body is light, carbonation medium-low. Very ""Northwest"" style IPA recipe-- reminds me of Terminal Gravity. Malt flavors are very earthy, husky and cereal-like. Hops are minty, green, leafy, and herbal. Malt body is lean and the hop bitterness holds throughout the finish. A nice PNW beer, I remember this being better at the brewpub in Seattle, but this isn't bad. Distinct and old school. "
903,2018,DrScotch,10/11/09," Copper-amber coloured ale with big head that hangs around. great grapefruit hop aroma, leads into solid hop flavour on a backbone of slightly sweet maltiness. Bitterness develops towards the finish. For me, this is how I like my American IPAs - not overly bitter, nicely balanced and THAT aroma of US hops, citrus and pine. "
904,2018,Rayek,10/7/09," A: Hazy pale amber with active carbonation. Foamy and dense off-white head has exemplary retention and leaves heavy lace. S: Heavy grapefruit with some lemon and fresh cut flowers. Pine and a little sugary sweetness linger in the background. T: Caramel sweet malt is quickly replaced with a rush of strong grapefruit, lemon and pepper bitterness. Grapefruit is the predominant hop flavor, and it lingers lightly into the finish. A well done combination of flavors. M: Medium body is very oily. Carbonation level is just a touch too high. D: Nicely done overall. Definitely worth a revisit. As with the other Elysian beer I've had, I'm curious as to how true this contract brewed version is to the original. "
905,2018,GarrisWH,10/7/09," A - Pours a slightly hazy, orange-tinged golden color with one finger of fluffy white head. Great retention and solid lacing. S - Pretty interesting hop aroma, with juicy citrus aromas - perhaps some orange and tangerine. There is an herbal, piney quality and a hint of tropical fruit as well. Sweet, bready malt in the background as well. T - A fairly balanced flavor overall, leaning just slightly more towards the hop profile. Fairly bitter, grapefruit flavor at first that leads into some bready, caramel malt flavors. An herbal, piney hoppiness noticeable in the finish. Definitely reminiscent of an English IPA, with a bit more attention to balance than a lot of American IPAs seem to have. I generally prefer a bit more hop kick in my IPAs, but this is a tasty brew nonetheless. M - On the lighter side of medium body with a moderate, fairly tingly carbonation. Maybe a little bit too light for an IPA, imo. D - There's no denying that this is a very drinkable beer. It has nice flavors, a nice hop character and is well done overall. A fairly mellow brew that could definitely make for a solid session beer. "
906,2018,indiapaleale,9/29/09," The Immortal, which I poured into a glass that was more fitting for a stronger beer, pours a bright golden, peachy color with a nice thick fluffy head. Its looks to me like a very well made beer. The aroma is grassy, grainy, some lemon, some pine along with caramel sweetness. Its not an overpoweringly hoppy smelling IPA, its much more subdued like an English IPA. One big sip of The Immortal and here we go. Plenty of malt backbone combines with some sweet orange and other citrus to make a pretty balanced IPA. Like I stated before, this is not going to numb your tongue with 130 IBUs, its much more subtle. Hell, its only 42 IBUs! Nonetheless, its got a lot of flavor and is very drinkable. I'd have to say that I really enjoy an American IPA (from time to time) that isn't over the top and whose hop bitterness doesn't leave my tongue bandaged and waiving a white flag. This is a solid session-able IPA from a great Pacific Northwestern brewery. Cheers Elysian! "
907,2018,jeffjeff1,9/16/09," This was another great IPA.I picked it up at Monument Wines and Spirits. Appearance- golden color, clear Smell- hoppy Taste- Hops Mouthfeel- medium bodied, smooth Drinkability- very good, thoroughly enjoyed it like most IPAs, will drink it again "
908,2018,almychristopher,9/8/09," 0% this beer pours a nice golden orange color with a thick white head that recedes slowly to a layer of lace. the aroma brings a good balance of hops and malt, but not the extreme hop aroma that I look for in an ipa. the taste brings a goodly amount of the citrus hops that the nose promised and puts in the running to be a good ipa. with the medium body and full on co2 it's a pretty good drink. "
909,50362,Sammy,6/9/09," Enjoyed on tap at ""Japon"" (French spelling) night at Dieu Du Ciel. Tastes like an aged beer, its very dry and cuvee-like. Significant hops.Its wierd but it does smell like a barleywine. Amber with white head. A bit undewhelming mouthfeel.There was some problem with foam in the taps, and maybe if I had this in the wee hours. Still good. "
910,216090,chuckgietzen,2/21/16,
911,2018,DIM,7/19/09," a: This was a cloudy golden color. It was served to me with a short, frothy white cap. s: I got some bready sweetness that had a little twang to it. The hops were a bit muted, smelling herbal with just a little pine. t: On the sweet side, lacking in bitterness for balance. The hops were very mild, spicy and a little bitter. The malts had an almost fruit juice quality. m: Well carbonated with a slightly oily body. d: An average IPA, nothing here to make it stand out. "
912,2018,beertunes,7/13/09," Served in straight pint glass. Poured a semi-hazy yellowish-amber with over an inch of thick white head that left a slightly more than average amount of lacing. A solid blast of pine and citrus hops greets the nose. The flavor follows along as expected, not much malt backbone as is typical for a PNW IPA. The body is slightly above average and this beer is as close as you can get to a session IPA. After a few palate fatigue will set in, but that is expected with the style. This is the best selling beer at one of my locals, they burn a keg every 4-5 days, so this certainly a favorite of the IPA loving locals. Worth seeking out. "
913,2018,PhillyStyle,7/8/09," On-tap at Falling Rock Tap House (Denver, CO) 12 oz pint glass Served a nice amber, light white fluffy head that had decent retention and nice lacing. Carbonation streaming to the top. Aroma is light hops. Not all that impressive. The taste is decent, hoppy but left a very dry aftertaste, very hoppy at times it was almost metallic. The beer has a medium body, smooth and drinkability suffered a bit due to the aftertaste. Overall, I was not all that impressed with the beer, it could have been that I had a Pliny before trying this beer and it could just not stand up. I will give this one another shot. But certainly not as good as Two Hearted, which I consider the gold standard when it comes to American IPA's. "
914,2018,pokesbeerdude,7/1/09," On guest tap at new belgium. A: copper colored with a white head, about half an inch in to nothing. Excellent clarity as well as lacing. Very nice looking beer. S: hops, pine and citrus, caramel, not much malt, but huge on the hops. Nice NW IPA. T: bitter and hoppy, pine and earth, very little malt backbone. Big time hop bomb. Nice beer all around. M: medium, light carbonation, nice and dry. D: easy drinking beer, not over the top and a nice beer to have. Will seek out again. "
915,2018,Kadonny,6/29/09," Poured from a bomber bottle into my Sam Adams pint glass. A: A darker golden orangy color with a huge, huge white fluffy billowy head. Too much head on a very conservative pour. Full sticky glass lacing. S: Citrus and pine hops with a bit of funk. Bready malt sweetness. T: Wow, not your run of the mill IPA. First hints of citrus hops with some floral notes and a bit of pine. Next comes the malt profile that really sets this beer apart. The malt is bready sweet with fruits and funk. Funk" Yes! The yeast used has a musty funk to it that really mixes well with the hops. Finish is crisp and dry. Very nice. M: My only gripe with this beer. Way overcarbonated. Even on a very conservative pour I get a half glass of head. Other than that, mouthfeel is crisp and clean with no hint of alcohol. D: High, real high. This is a great beer. Overall I really loved the very unique flavors of this IPA with the funky fruit and citrus flavors. Very well done, not your run of the mill IPA. I'm definitely seeking out more of this beer. Great! "
916,2018,gdfan47,6/24/09," A- pours a nice murky amber with a little bit of off white head S- Hops ,Hops! some ammarilo (maybe") and some more citrusy ones T- more hops with some malty notes as well. Solid overall , I think Elysian might use the same yeast for quite a few beers cause the background of the beer was simular to the last elysian i had M- very nice, good carbonation, a little cold, but thats how the bar served it D- very nice, relativly low abv. Pretty easy to drink pretty solid beer, ill def reach for this again "
917,2018,blackc5,6/9/09," Im a fan of many of the Elysian brews, and this one doesn't disappoint. Poured at 45F. A- Pours a translucent golden orange. Wonderful pillowy, cloud-like head that just hangs and hangs. Some really impressive lacing too. S- Fairly mild but maybe just my cold yet interfering. Grapefruit and lemon, with a little floral and sweet caramel. T- First taste is a nice roasted malty sweetness that quickly fades to citrus. Some apricot hidden amongst the grapefruit. A bit of pine on the aftertaste, increasingly bitter as it warms. Overall, tastes nicely fruity and very refreshing. A great IPA. M - Smooth and creamy. Resiny. Light carbonation. D- Very high. Alcohol is well-masked at first taste. Very well rounded, and easy enough to down this 22 oz bomber. Enjoyed this one a lot, and a nice deal at $3.49 for a bomber. "
918,2018,popery,6/3/09," I expect a lot out of an American IPA, and I particularly expect an abundance of hops. At 42 IBUs, this beer clocks in at a level that I more expect to see in an APA than IPA. I don't know if this is the result of hop-happy craft brewers skewing style expectations or what. However, this beer does straddle the APA-IPA border according to the BJCP guidelines, so it's not an entirely baseless assertion. The Immortal IPA pours a middle-of-the-road golden color that's true to style. The thick, foamy head leaves copious lacing. The smell is dominated by a citric-floral hop aroma. There's a touch of caramel malt, but it's mostly a fairly sweet hop-forward aroma. The flavor just really doesn't work for me. I like aggressively hoppy IPAs, and this beer does not fit that bill. On the other hand, the malt flavor isn't strong enough to carry things, either. The malt is more bready than caramel. I guess the beer could be called balanced, but that term is highly subjective and largely meaningless. At any rate, it's an ok beer and largely loses points through style comparison rather than specific flaws. Elysian clearly knows how to make beer. I just disagree with their preferences for this style. "
919,2018,reinheitsgebot83,6/2/09," 22 oz. bottle from the Craft Beer Outlet, NE Philadelphia; as I'm typing. A: Pours with a golden amber color and a slightly off-white head. Retention is good, lace is moderate. S: Light hop aroma, especially for an IPA, also significant notes of the yeast. T: Briskly hoppy, not quite as much as I expect from an IPA, with malt undertones. M: Bottle conditioned carbonation gives a smooth feel initially and it ends with slightly dry in the back of the mouth. D: Crisp feel and mild flavor makes it go down easily and enjoyably. All in all, it's a good beer. "
920,2018,yesyouam,3/31/09," Elysian The Immortal IPA is a dense, slightly hazy, bubbly golden ale with a thick, frothy, foamy off-white head that has great retention and lacing. It has a syrupy sweet aroma like malt candy and something floral. It is medium-full bodied; very smooth and syrupy. It's kind of bitter, but quite sweet. The sweetness is a bit much. It actually kind of tastes floral, like violet candy. It's pretty good, but I didn't really need a full bomber of this. I'm sweet enough already. "

923,2018,OStrungT,5/22/09," This beer pours a clear light golden yellow color, with a thin white head. The head fades slowly, leaving a pretty decent lacing. This beer has a mildly hoppy aroma. It isnt as strong as I expected. It smells floral, with a touch of pine. It has a slightly sweet aroma also. This beer tastes exactly like it smells. It is more of a pale ale than an IPA. Not hoppy at all. This beer is carbonated well. It leaves a sweet malty aftertaste. This beer may make a decent session beer. Lowish alcohol, and a decent flavor make it ok. Overall: I dont think this beer was much of an IPA. It is a decent beer, however rating on style, this beer is not that great. I am sorry. "
924,2018,xhcadamx,5/14/09," A - super hazy orange with a mountain sized white head. Nice creamy lacing. S - C hops with a touch of pineapple. A sweetness is present. T - Pleasantly bitter with the C hops and pineapple present. Nice malt backbone that allows this to be balanced but still showcase the hops. M - obviously bottle conditioned which gives it a softer carbonation. D - well balanced but nothing extraordinary "
925,2018,GilGarp,5/9/09," Brewed for Elysian by New Belgium in Fort Collins. Pours into my NB globe with very hazy golden orange color and thick white head. The head is really the best part about this beer's appearance. Very creamy and long lasting with nice lace. It's similar in looks to a good Belgian saison. Aroma is sweet and hoppy with a little citrus and fresh grass. Nothing exceptional but it's pleasant. Flavor is nicely done too with good balance between bitterness and sweetness. It has a little bit of apple and carmel sweetness although not like a carmel apple, thankfully. There is also some mild grapefruit and other citrus. Mouthfeel is medium body with good level of carbonation. Very smooth and easy drinking for an IPA. Overall one of the better balanced IPAs I've had. It may lean more towards the English version in sweetness but with a healthy dose of American hops. "
926,2018,glid02,5/4/09," 0% Had this courtesy of Rus - much obliged! Pours a deep copper color with a one-finger off-white head. The head recedes into a patchy layer on top leaving decent lacing. Smells of pale malts with hints of floral and citrus hops - this smells just hoppy enough to justify the American IPA tag. Tastes similar to how it smells. Pale malt flavors are joined by light citrus malt flavors midway through the sip, but the malt is in control throughout. Slightly bitter ending. Mouthfeel is good. It's a bit on the thin side, but good carbonation makes this one go down smoothly. Drinkability is good. I had no problem finishing my glass and could have a few more of these. Overall this is a good American IPA but there are better ones out there. "
927,2018,gford217,5/3/09," 12oz bottle shared at the Brick Store. Pours a clear golden with a fluffy white head that recedes pretty quickly and leaves little lacing. The aroma is almost as malty as it is hoppy with lots of caramel malts with a hints of floral and earthy hops on top. The taste follows the aroma with a little more hops than the aroma would suggest. It's got a little bit of citrus and floral hops up front before the generous malt profile takes over. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and almost too thin. It's got good carbonation and a pretty subdued hop profile which leads to little bitterness on the palate. This a well-balanced and very drinkable IPA that could probably use a little more hops to make it great. Still, not bad. "
928,2018,chiral3,4/30/09," I found this beer simply OK. It was clean. Perhaps a bit to clean. It felt thin - in taste and mouthfeel. This made it quite drinkable. There was something subtle that was quite good, but the signal was too distant. Perhaps years of dipas and big IPAs have clouded my (our) judgement, but I felt is was lacking that thing IPAs need, and it isn't the grain bill. The mouthfeel frankly solidified my opinion. The taste was thin, as was the mouthfeel. Not floral enough. No pine or citrus. It may have been in there, but it was too subtle. An average beer with some real potential. "
929,2018,yeastsipper,4/20/09," Beer pours a nice foggy light copper color with nice head. Smell is very nice. Floral much more than piney. Malt is very evident on the nose. Very soapy, definitely the dominant smell. Soap evident in the taste as well, as well as floral. There is the Earl Gray breakfast tea flavor i get from red ales. Quite bitter going done and leaves a blanket of bitterness on the palate that lingers. Mouthfeel is a touch week as for me, the body is a touch light and watery. Pretty darn good stuff, though not in the upper echelon of other IPAs I have had. "
930,2018,cvfish,4/20/09," A - This beer poured a hazy golden color that produced a fluffy white head that had good retention and laced the side of the glass nicely S - This beer produced aromas of the hop flower, but also some sweet, possibly honey, scents, followed by some maltiness T - This IPA was one of the best tasting IPA's I've had, very flavor and complex, nice maltiness, bitterness of the hops, a little sweetness, and some pine wood taste M - The body of this beer had a medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation D - This was a very good IPA, not on Simcoe or Torpedo level for me, but very close, a must have if you can find this gem "
931,2018,froghop,4/18/09," pours a semi-cloudy amber-orange with a small off-white head that goes away quickly, and good lacing. smell of grapefruit, citrus sweet, a touch of pine, some caramel, and orange. taste is somewhat creamy, dry leaves, a light sweet, light bitter, a little orange, touch of caramel, some pine, and some nuts in the back, ends bitter with a sweet aftertaste. "
932,2018,Dogbrick,4/16/09," Sample at the Pike Street location. The beer is a clear orange color with a medium thin white head that diminishes steadily. Rings of lacing on the glass. Citrusy and hoppy aroma with light malt in the background. Medium-bodied and moderately hoppy with flavors of citrus and pine along with some malt. The finish is somewhat hoppy with a lingering bitterness left over. Above average all around. "
933,2018,erok,4/8/09," A - Gold, chill haze appaent. Pours with a white head that dissipates somewhat quickly. Nice lacing. B - Smell, some nice aroma of hops, but not as strong on the aroma hops as I've come to enjoy. Perhaps the beer is too old. It's about 2 months out of date. C - Love it, great malt and hop balance. The hop bitterness could stand to be a little more complex, and would benefit from additional dry-hopping to add aroma complexity to the flavor profile. M - Medium bodied, satisfying. Neither dry nor cloying. D - I just polished off a 22 ounce bomber without thinking about it. "
934,2018,jujubeast6000,1/15/09," Reviewed 5/30/2006 (Tap @ Elysian brewery, Tangletown, WA): Pours a golden amber colored body, slightly cloudy, with a big white head, smallish bubbles. Has a very hoppy aroma, sweet, but not too hoppy. A slight bitter taste, very sweet. Nutty. Slight acidic aftertaste. "

936,2018,scruffwhor,3/11/09," Ordered online from Shoppers Vineyard in NJ. Holy head!! Maybe two inches of beer and six inches of shaving cream like head. Amber sort of ginger ale and orange peekoo tea with hardcore champagne bubbling. Great sticking and retention. Almost ""5"" worthy, but their is too much of a good thing. The six ich head after a very soft pour was too much. Very citrusy and floral nose, but not much malty scents. The taste makes me think of danelions and grapfruit rinds. Maybe a little crystal malt as the beer warms. A slightly metallic and chewey herbal palate. "
937,2018,williamherbert,3/1/09," Pours an uncharacteristic light golden color. The head is thick and white like shaving cream. Carbonation like ginger ale. The smell is a standard -- but inviting -- IPA aroma. Bready with a flowery pilsnery hop. Some pine needles, but a touch of chlorine. The taste is very bready malt, with lightly toasted barley. They are a nice foundation for the sharp estery hop. Dandelions and weeds. Roasted black licorice and tobacco come through with more warmth. Leaves a thick, burnt film on the tongue. Sweet and flowery, but with a thick, heavily roasted malt base. An English IPA with flowery American hops. Starts sweet; ends bitter. "
938,2018,GJ40,2/26/09," Sampled from a 22oz bottle in a Double Mountain Tulip glass. Purchased at Pike Street Beer & Wine in Seattle. A - Golden in color with a slight haze. It's got a thick creamy head with lots of lacing. A very inviting look. S - Citrusy and floral hops with some toasted malt and yeast as well. T - Starts malty and a bit sweet but then turns bitter and citrusy. It's a pretty complex beer with lots of different flavors coming together very nicely. One of the more balanced west coast IPAs. M - Low carbonation with good body. D - Very enjoyable and easy to drink. Not quite as good as it is served on cask at the brewery but still very nice. "
939,2018,EPICAC,2/21/09," On tap at Jimmy's No. 43 in NYC. Pours a clear copper. Topped by a fluffy, creamy, beige head that leaves clinging sheets of lace. The aroma is fairly light overall. Notes of citric hop, and some resin, but hard to place. Bready and toasty malts set the stage for a wave of strong hop-bitterness that's dominated by resiny and citric hops. Oily and medium bodied on the palate with high carbonation. Hop-focused with good hop flavors. "
940,2018,RonfromJersey,2/18/09," Initial pour eventually settles into half orange body, good clarity, with loads of carbonation streams, and half huge sticky snow white head. Slight, slight lemon aroma. Rarely does one have to work so hard at sniffing an ipa. Nice solid malty base. Tasty citrus fruit. More hop nip than bite at the swallow. Mild fruity aftertaste. Good mouthfeel has some firmness to it. Easy going drinkability. A tasty beer but more pale ale than ipa to me, and more suited to six packs than bombers. "
941,2018,AltBock,2/14/09," 22 oz. bomber bottle with a dark blue/purple label that has a rather crude drawing of Zeus. He looks like an early Street Fighter II character. This crude drawing shows Zeus sitting on top of his throne with his left arm resting of a cloud, while his right hand is holding a big bolt of lightning. Just below his left arm is his pet Griffon. To the far left of the label is where they keep all the mandatory US information. The far right side has the Brewer's signature and two paragraphs. The top paragraph talks about the beer and the bottom one talks about the brewhouse. I failed to see any kind of best before date or batch number. Appearance: I poured this ""Immortal"" beer into an Imperial Brooklyn Brewery pint glass. When this IPA was poured, this beer was nothing but foam. For every 1/4 of an inch of beer, there was about 4 inches of foam on top of it. After about 10 minutes of waiting for the head of foam to recede, I found out this beer was a hazy golden orange color that had a small tint of copper blended in with it. When this head of foam receded, it left behind a massive amount of white sticky streaks of lace around the glass. As you can tell, this beer had one of those annoying heads of foam. it took forever for it to recede and the only time I got to sip the beer was when I scooped away about 1 1/2 inches of foam away. Despite the annoying head of foam, this beer still had a great appearance to it. Smell: Some IPAs favor the scent of tart grapefruit while others might favor the scent of bitter citrus hops. This beer didn't favor any of those. Instead, this IPA favored the scent of lemon peel. I don't know why, but it did. Directly behind the strong scent of lemon peel was a hint of pine, juicy ruby red grapefruit, a splash of orange peel, a pinch of crispy and bitter citrus hops, and then this lemon peel based aroma finishes up with a subtle touch of caramel malts. Swirling this beer around will only let out more grapefruit, lemon peel, and pine. In the end, it was more fruity than hoppy. Fruity with a hop bite aroma. Taste: After the ""fruity with a hop bite"" aroma, I thought the beer was going to taste a little like that. Instead, this beer's taste was mostly all about the bitter and crispy floral hops with a few bitter citrus hops behind that. ""The Immortal"" started off a little fruity with ruby red grapefruit, lemons, and oranges. Then out of nowhere, the taste goes on the bitter offensive side with bitter floral and citrus hops. Then after the hops had enough, the taste ends with a subtle touch of toasted caramel malts and a tiny splash of pine needles. A good IPA, but I thought this beer could have unleashed a tad bit more citrus fruits and pine. Mouthfeel: This Elysian beer was a medium bodied beer with a mild to strong aftertaste of bitter and crispy citrus and floral hops, a hint of dried ruby red grapefruit, a touch of lemon peel, and a splash of pine. This bitter aftertaste wasn't immortal. It lingered on for a minute or two and then it was gone forever. Drinkability: If you like your IPAs crispy and bitter with a few varieties of hops and a touch of citrus fruits, then you might think about giving this Elysian beer a try. I thought this beer was kind of in the middle of the road on the mildly hopped route of America. Would I ever buy this beer again" Nah, one bottle was good enough. It is worth a shot though. "
942,2018,Magpie14,2/9/09," A: light golden highlights fused with lightly clouded copper color. This was topped with a reasonable bleach white foamy cap, rather dense I might add. Some bubbles were working overtime and get a good grade for extra effort S: well at first whiff things seemed a little timid and nothing really jumped out at me. Has the typical blend of pale malts and citrusy hops, maybe some dry pine notes T: considering the name ""The Immortal IPA"" I was hoping for a bit more. It has its moments and some well rounded features otherwise it runs off a bit lackluster. Hops are of the sweet citrusy variety. I seem to get some oranges and soft grapefruit sprinkled with sugar. However, my palate keeps telling me that the malts are the stronger force at the helm. Pale biscuity malts covered with caramel and possess a light huskiness. I am also struggling with the fact that the flavors come and go...where are the hops" M: good body, nice and mild. Goes down rather smooth and yet carbonation makes the mouthfeel a bit foamy at times. Hops are in the back after a few sips, barely... D: I will reach for many other IPA's before this one. More hops please! Still this is a nice rendition and worth a try "
943,2018,RedDiamond,1/27/09," I suppose the immortal aspect of this beer derives from its carbonation. The bubbles just won't die and show an uncommon energetic boil sustaining a light cap of vivid white head with polka dot lace. Immortal's body is perilously clear in warm copper though I was surprised to note such a restrained aroma. The hops spend most of their time in the bittering range where they deliver a solid kick of flavor that would seem to extend beyond their reputed 42 IBU. Not as crisp as some others, for the bittering has a recessed heaviness to it that pivots on a bit of yeast tang. "
944,2018,jdense,1/25/09," 22 oz. bomber from Whole Foods Hazy strawish yellow color, a bit on the light side colorwise for NW IPAs. Quickly dissipating rocky head. if handled correctly the head isn't a problem. Not too harsh on the palate up front or back, a bit of grapefruit with figs. Nice balance between hops and malt. Pretty drinkable. A good fit with spicy foods. A quality quaffable from one of Washington's better breweries. Worth seeking out for hopheads, though not in the hop bomb category. "
945,2018,ATPete,1/21/09," 22oz bottle The bottle send a thundering 'POP!' upon popping the cap. An enormous thick white head forms with a gentle pour, a yellow orange tinged IPA lay beneath. This head is STRONG and relentless, the minutes tick by, and i still cant drink this beer yet! In my opinion that hurts its drinkability score. I had to pour, even more gently (but to no avail), 5-6 times to actually fill the glass to a suitable drinking height. The nose here is nice, semi floral, mild, but definitely hoppy. However, it didn't get much better once i was able to actually drink this beer. Way over carbonated, Belgian-esque but with out the complimenting characters, foamy, not even a decent quaff without an explosion of foam mid palate continuing into and through the finish. Sweet malts are picked up mostly on the aftertaste but the bitter, English-style, hop character is apparent throughout. I think without its obvious carbonation issues this would be a damn fine English IPA, but unfortunately, for now this beer is 1st on the list of disappointments of 2009. "
946,2018,Docer,1/20/09," Grabbed a 22oz. Bottle from Fred Meyer... poured into a tumbler.. Not so copper like the bottle stated... but a very so slightly cloudy golden color... much like an avg. pale. Not very much head at all... although I dont slam-pour beers, I tilt the glass. Obvious minimal lacing thanks to the yeast. I couldn't hardly smell a thing with this number. Maybe a slight floral smell with a tad bit of barley and light malt. A rather bitter and creamy taste. Bright hop and bitter citrus.. rather good carbonation. Tastes like a refreshing pale.. mouthfeel is bitter but not dry. Easy to drink, although a little too bubbly for a pale. IPA" Not to me... it's a Pale. "

950,2018,BuffaloTapHugger,1/14/09," Purchased 22 oz. bomber at Consumers Beverage on Elmwood Ave. Poured into a pint glass. Crazy head tension, had too let settle before inhaling. Three minutes later... A hazy orange fog appears as the color, smells of pine and orange peel come to my mind. Gulp. Not too overly hoped, malts are very present. Little bitter on the after take, just the right amount of alcohol present. More toward the English style IPA can some this beer up. Recommended: To those who enjoy the IPA style across the pond, made right here in America. "
951,2018,StJamesGate,1/11/09," Pours pale yellow with lots of sediment and a big, pillowy head that just doesn't go down. Nose like a chardonnay: wood, grass, fruit. Taste is pear notes, with lemongrass cutting at the end. Bitterness lingers. I had an especially athletic bottle that poured mostly head for the first hour - overconditioned, maybe" In spite of that, comes off a little thin and bitter, I keep looking for the malts that aren't there. This keeps it from real sessionability. "
952,2018,olmatty,1/11/09," Appearance- Pours a fluffy bright-white three finger head so thick I took a bite and chewed it. Good lacing and excellent retention. A pale copper liquid with tiny bubbles Smell- Light, fresh hops overpower most malt aroma Taste- Biscuity toasted malt followed by substantial hopiness. Malts and hops trade places a couple of times during a taste creating a complex and beautifully balanced beer. Mouthfeel- Crisp carbonation and thinner liquid than the flavor would suggest. Drinkability- A very drinkable IPA, nothing overpowering, but quite good. "
953,2018,LilBeerDoctor,1/10/09," Bottle. Pours a clear light orange with a thick off-white head. Aroma of floral hops, sweet malt. Flavor of light floral hops, toasted malt and a touch of diacetyl. Nice and drinkable. Simple, but good. Aroma: 7/10 Appearance: 4/5 Flavor: 8/10 Palate: 4/5 Overall: 14/20 (3.7/5) "
954,2018,midaszero,1/5/09," A - Clear golden orange body with a small white head and some decent lacing. S - Sweet citrus hops T - Nice clean and balanced hop flavor with some caramel malt flavor. M - Medium body with medium carbonation D - Excellently crafted and balanced. This is one of my new favorite IPAs. Easy to drink and very enjoyable. "
955,2018,Kendo,12/24/08," A: Poured into a Sam Smith's nonic. Body is a clear golden-amber wtih a half-finger off-white head. Good lace at the top of the glass, not so much on the way down. S: Not too strong, but clean -- citrus (orange peel and grapefruit) and a hint of pine. T: Pale (think biscuity or cracker-like) and caramel malt is followed by a nice hop bite, with lingering citrus and pine. Especially pine -- but it's not overpowering or palate-shredding at all. As it warms the malt body seems almost fruity -- or is that lemony/citrusy fruityness coming from the hops" Either way, there's a nice balance between hops and malt, and the lingering piney bitterness doesn't destroy the tastebuds as some western IPAs tend to do. Balance is the key here. M: A tad lighter than medium bodied with a slightly creamy feel. D: Excellent. Clean but flavorful. Went down real easy. "
956,2018,bitterthebetter,12/19/08," pours a rich copper orange with creamy white sulty head rich piney hops upfront, with smooth malt and citrus notes surprisingly crisp and upfront with the hops showing pine, citrus and a good spicy notes on the finish deceptively big bodied and crisp, with subtle hoppy aggresiveness, slight malt balance but its mostly hops a great beer for the price, big, sturdy hoppiness makes it for a great 22 "
957,2018,Spikester,12/18/08," Pours amber with a decent cream colored head and good lacings. Aroma is citrus hops some pine. Taste is bitter citrus hops and a good amount of roasted malts. Pretty well balanced for an IPA. Bitter dry grapefruit finish. Drinkability is very good. Might be a short session but enjoyable. "
958,2018,t0rin0,12/3/08," 22oz bottle sent to me by a friend in Seattle. Pours incredibly clear brown with a seemingly everlasting white head that is silky smooth and laces the glass quite well. I sipped my half of the bottle (from a pint glass) for an hour and there was still lacing and head. Some sediment at the bottom but it stayed put. Aroma is of piney hops, malt, and alcohol. Alcohol comes out more as it warms up as does the malt. Flavor is quite bitter, possibly a bit old, slightly malty, a tad piney, and very dry in the aftertaste. Body is thin, semi-highly carbonated, and drinkable. Good hot weather beer but maybe a little high in abv for such a beer. "

961,2018,NittanyBeerFan,12/3/08," A: This beer was really rough to pour. I was trying to divide this into two glasses, and it was a huge foamy mess. There is clearly a ton of carbonation in this beer. On the bright side, this beer laces very well! The color is a golden amber with a slight haze. Sediment lingers suspended in the beer. S: Smell is maltier than I expected for a single IPA. One the other hand though, I can make out a slight citrus smell in the hop bitterness. T: Caramel malts and simcoe hops come together almost masterfully. Caramel begins and malt sweetness closes, and in the middle, I get a nice grapefruit flavored hop bitterness. Other than that, not a whole lot goin on in the flavor. M/D: Tangy carbonation and a light to medium texture. Texture makes it drinkable, but i don't think I would go for more than one of these unless it was easier to pour. "

Poured from a 22oz. bottle into my shaker glass a clear golden yellow color with about two fingers of pillowy white head. A moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass with each sip.
