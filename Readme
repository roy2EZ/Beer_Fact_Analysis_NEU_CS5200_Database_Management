Beer Fun Fact Analysis project for database management course 
Sep. - Dec. 2019
This project designed and implemented an database for analyze rating and reviews of 350000+ beer brands in US:
- Implement a database with MySQL of beer rating and reviews record from following open data sources:  
  https://www.kaggle.com/ehallmar/beers-breweries-and-beer-reviews
- Developed a web application to query the database and display results using Java JDBC/JSP:
  - Use JDBC to build the data access layer for all classes
  - Use JSP to build the web application
  - Run on Tomcat server
  - Use web application to perform create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations on database
- Data Warehousing
  Two External Data Source for data warehousing:
  External data source 1:
    Federal Holidays U.S.A. 1966-2020: https://www.kaggle.com/gsnehaa21/federal-holidays-usa-19662020
    To see relationship between holidays and amount of users reviews.
     
  External data source 2:
    Average Annual Temperature for Each US State: https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/US/average-annual-state-temperatures.php
    To see relationship between Brewing State average temperature and Beer taste.
    
  Used CloverDX for data warehousing for analysis of relationship between beer taste and temperature.
